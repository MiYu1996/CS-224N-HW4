You know what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> as a farmer, or with leather clothing.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that fell to you somewhere.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare class.
When I went to bleed every week in the toilet for the boys, until a teacher saved me life.
She saved my life for letting me go into the bathroom <unk>
I was doing it on secret.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations who were fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, in the night I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I am <unk> we have never been to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man to know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to stand up with this, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it a place, the <unk> and take care of her family, because it was necessary, and it was.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of ashes and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you about was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs all the rest of life.
It needs true and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was amazed.
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I placed them around me <unk> from the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think it was a <unk> about another <unk> about another <unk> year after year.
The <unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers and you break the walls of ice.
Every iceberg has their individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people who refuse to give and hold themselves up to the end, while others cannot be able to get them more and get themselves into a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, by looking at a <unk> which are isolated separated from themselves, as much as we see ourselves as a human.
But the reality is the opposite.
As you melts a <unk> I'm breathing its atmosphere <unk>
As you melts a iceberg releases freshwater water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it was trying to be the portraits of my ancestors, to know that in these unique moments there are in that way and will never be going to be over that way.
It's not death when it's <unk> not an end, but one continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> which photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you is a iceberg I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually get a <unk> iceberg here.
Here you go.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg <unk>
It's about about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is real time.
And so he <unk> the iceberg a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, at the same time, every single <unk> a baby.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to stay too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about conception -- yes, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the chromosome joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X X of the sperm joins up to the X X of the <unk>
Both of them <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity in my ground on two roles.
In one of my roles I work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> for training, and what I study in this case is the way people started the anatomy -- which is that of human bodies and <unk> how they have thought of body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role you do in my work is an activist, like an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social rules.
I've been working on, for example, with identical twins -- two people within one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people who are much lower than the average.
And I've been working with a lot of cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physical self doesn't fit into male male <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> lots of ways.
I'm going to put a few examples of ways to have sex that don't fit into male common forms or female.
So for example, there's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> <unk> which is <unk> of the chromosome and says to the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> that they become <unk>
And then, in life, the testes produce testosterone.
But because this individual doesn't have testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
Is <unk> <unk>
So there are high levels of testosterone but no response.
As a consequence, the body develops following one course typically female.
When you look at the baby as a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing cancer, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
After making tests realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and a y chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women like men, we have in the body something called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I think -- I think a <unk> woman knows not the <unk> structure, I think it's a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles who have <unk> syndrome.
That's why sex is complicated -- it's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a way, can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I received a call from an 19 year-old years born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and I had a life as a boy and he had just found that he had <unk> and <unk>
It had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I had the 20th chromosomes and the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, creating a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormonal component -- typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was at 19 years when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, was women in the inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes now develop what is known as <unk> is to say, have tissue <unk> wrapped in tissue tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So there are many varieties of sex.
The reason why kids with these kinds of bodies are <unk> twins or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it comes to several surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have <unk> identity, being black to say to have African anatomy in terms of <unk>
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you give us a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very bold ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic <unk>
Imagine how surprising it is to have kids that are born as two people in one body.
The most high case is last year with the South African South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his sex at the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What do you test to do to determine whether you're <unk> <unk> is a guy or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no test.
In fact, we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought were <unk> <unk> categories that would come directly with <unk> categories that are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology of the terminology is.
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do we <unk> in fact <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we moved into science we get more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at first, and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which one body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered died.
Our ancestors had never had to do with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved it still without the <unk>
If I stopped moving it to him.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs of a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with the dilemma to determine really somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I am liberal, giving people <unk> but I have to admit that he gets me nervous.
We need these categories to be much more fragile than we thought we were <unk>
<unk> from the concept of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, I find each other and see that piece of music, <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> were, for me, the first activists in the anatomy and I explain why.
What they were <unk> was a <unk> concept, and I was able to fill it with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what we <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming into political power passed from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
And they <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the <unk> differences -- that was a very radical thing.
And in part they were doing because they formed part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and the same time <unk> science.
And it remains very clear, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a world <unk>
They were <unk> from the explanations for <unk> and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be passed through a kind of a vague <unk> of the right of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look at the example, the <unk> of <unk> talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were broadcasting the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were laid the foundations of the future of Human Rights
They didn't think that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women are <unk>
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color who would bring to <unk> <unk> about the difference and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we need to start asking ourselves why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> on anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five-year-old kids should be allowed to have sexual relationships or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that I have felt that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two kinds of beings in the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Now, Henry, in the other hand, was born in term: <unk> was born.
For the fact that I was born three months before Mary was attributed to all three months before Henry -- before Henry -- the right to sexual consent, the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different age, but because he was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
So Henry, at virtue of being considered a man -- if I have not told you if it's <unk> at virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the <unk> of Mary that Mary doesn't have to worry.
He doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So there are still these <unk> categories.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science moved both in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of attitude attitude -- "Well, we need to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But many people are stuck in a strange position.
For instance, Texas at some point Texas has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome and you have to get married with a woman and you have to get a <unk>
Now, in practice they don't test for people <unk> people.
But this is also very strange because of the story that I told you about the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I would refer to <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea feels like a good one."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do people judge the contents of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that I am not sure that we should be able to give people rights to people, because I have to admit that I know about some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent people and <unk> on their sex relationships that people from 40 I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking of thinking about the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed by less who is willing to submit to a change of sex, in which case you get to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon who talked about a couple years ago that I had done a couple years ago that he had done to give birth twins and then pick them up, and then they <unk> his name.
But when the phone asked him the reason for the <unk> operation, a very <unk> operation, told me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum rather than the separation of <unk>
America offers huge possibilities for people to be who are not <unk> to change the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be the head.
Well, to finish I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what the democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> different <unk> if there are people thinking about a group.
For years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in looking at the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in Feminism <unk> I considered <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what is women's <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking stereotypes of gender, so there is nothing <unk> in <unk>
But the more I thought about your question, most of you have something about the <unk>
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different between the brain and male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So even though the <unk> were very attentive to find the way to protect people from the state, it's possible that they have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we get democracy beyond <unk> think less in the individual body in terms of identity, and to think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a <unk> let's think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where you want to live and work on, it has the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, we are far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count in one city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth a lot more than their cost of construction.
So we could easily give the world to the <unk> maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just <unk> by building buildings.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartment to be owners and the other half still <unk> to do it.
You might try to increase the capacity by making expansion in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that we <unk> is that those buildings and the areas around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions of construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a whole new place, and build a whole new apartment building, again, and when the rules of that place to build the construction instead of putting <unk>
So I proposed that governments are going to save new reform zones to contain cities and give them a name, cities under <unk>
Later I learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> <unk> they would go out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the following regular election, <unk> <unk> took a platform for a platform in which I reforms reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most exciting ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say you cannot go and pick up all the current residents of apartments.
<unk> a lot of attention to new technologies, but it needs so much of the technologies for <unk> and usually the rules that keep us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with the TEDTalk.
He showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities are, so much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> in some cases, thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> which is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not to live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included in an image like this, which was about explaining that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport is covering over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince <unk> that to build a new city, you need to start with a place that is measuring at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everybody <unk> <unk>
The faces of the public were very serious and <unk>
The Congress came up to the platform, and he said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained the <unk> that a new city can provide new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city to the one that you could go could be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from the North.
And we also have new choices for leaders.
Because the government leaders would need help from <unk> countries, they could benefit from the countries associated with the partners that help us establish and make the rules of <unk> so that they can all rely on the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw one site.
This picture is there.
It could be just a thousand square miles.
And little later, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and to add a constitutional arrangement that would allow these special developmental environments.
In a country that I had just passed through this <unk> crisis, voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All of us are looking at all of them in society, <unk>
To <unk> the Constitution has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17th was approved in another voting in <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting in February 21 of February, a shifting of about 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that's being built in North Korea is bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years after it spent four years after they were getting the <unk>
The other country in the building of cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this sort of practical. This is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second town.
They are setting up a legal system that would allow the <unk> administrators and then would allow to operate under an external legal system?
A country has been committed to allowing her Supreme Court to be the court of the last instance for this new <unk>
There are <unk> and builders, cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are lots of companies who wanted to move in the <unk> especially in a place with a <unk> zone, and there's a lot of people who would like to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change the other place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to get a job job, and sometimes they're moms who have to earn the money for just to eat or buy clothing.
Sadly, sometimes even children are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What seems to think about insist that the families can choose between many cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Thank you, TED <unk>
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what is inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and it's that I obsessed with the <unk>
I love to find, dress, and more recently, photographing and published on my blog and colorful suits and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from second hand of <unk> <unk> markets and <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to know people who are <unk> usually my money goes to a good <unk> and my aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my <unk>
I love color for?"
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
Coming back to my <unk> I want to tell you what it was going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings you to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothing and nothing else.
It's inside for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I'd like to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And since I don't know how the woman you walk in at TED,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you the <unk> for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger here.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always see you phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me to me, and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just get away with you, too.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you get in.
Sometimes people tell me that you seem to play <unk> or I remember their little <unk>
I like <unk> and saying, <unk>
<unk> is the key.
If you think you're doing good with something, it's pretty much sure you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably true too.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the age of 30 that really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inside and outside, there is no look you can't afford to.
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: The gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and unique style is a cool way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and over again when people came up to me this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is obviously going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, and I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to hate these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left-hand side, which is the logic -- and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you look at a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you <unk> your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> on both of them at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually exclusive.
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, as well as most of the other quantum physicists <unk> we need a lot of logic for <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them, and then we see how they react. And then we developed our intuition from that point.
And you actually do the same thing.
<unk> intuition that you can have developed over the years is that one thing can be only in a place at a time.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you're not born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet the playing with that bar in a parking lot taught him a valuable lesson -- and it's that the big things don't allow them to be <unk> and stay in a place.
This is a big conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you are a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars -- play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or that they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years -- you need from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need you to describe the big objects around us every day.
That's not really good at my intuition, and it's perhaps because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it's also not really good at my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why I didn't should.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object is also following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just at the center.
And then we do a very big approach to the small metal <unk>
So what we see is a little bit of metal, with a springboard and <unk> and <unk> on a platform.
And so I did this almost in the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a chip with a silicon chip and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of <unk> swimming that it is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum <unk> but for it it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird, weird, but then when other people go up and leave those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> objects are not just people, and they're not just people -- it's also the light that we <unk> and the wind that goes on to their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to drive all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We put the lights on, and then you get a <unk> and we pulled all the air, and then they put it to a temperature of less degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just going to be in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free of acting as it wants.
So we measure their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, she was <unk> and the way he <unk> was like a breath in this form -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft soft, we were able to make it <unk> and not to do the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you about is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing, and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up to the top and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what it means is that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was <unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference in scale between one atom and that little piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places -- why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logical part of speech.
So imagine if they were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do they act -- if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we <unk> it and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box, we saw that the metal still kept in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects in the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about what quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so <unk>
It's more than that, it's <unk>
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound <unk> of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And about 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head that is here and that allowed me to take it.
It took me 18 months.
There's a lot of negotiations and stories -- it was <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explaining just to this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and going to museums, I started to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great people, and we started doing it.
Better to show the demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we have done from his launch.
So, let's go to <unk>
Look around all the museums that there are.
There's the <unk> gallery at MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, at <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click on and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and you <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the top, and with one click, we jump into it.
They're inside, that you want to go at the end of the hall,
And keep you going. What are you going to do.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information of <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10 billion <unk>
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get to do with 10 billion <unk>
It can zoom around around very simple.
You see things that are going on.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have a price.
But if you really want to do it.
So I started to play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
I walked in, and I discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
So I was talking a little bit, I talked to some <unk> people -- and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is hitting a <unk> with a Tuesday Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper into depth and you'll see that you can actually reach the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're very quickly going to jump over at MoMA, in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh -- actually created this piece of work.
It makes it up and really that we <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts of this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen this before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool thing. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can actually create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call <unk> <unk> -- we just got a zooming here.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk> works.
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even they don't come from the museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope in this digital means to do justice to their work of art and that is represented properly online.
And the big question I'm doing today is this: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> <unk>
We call it sensitive design.
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian background, all the kids in Italy -- and they grow up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened something very interesting in <unk> careers in the last two decades.
There was some time, if you wanted to win a career. One, I would take a budget and put it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the career.
This is what in engineering, the control system will become real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming computers in the open.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of <unk> consumption of <unk> and 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for a year at MoMA, over the summer.
It's called <unk> Uncle <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, begin to <unk>
So in a way, it's like almost all atoms in the existing atoms and <unk> sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outer environment.
In some sense, it's almost like <unk> dream.
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says that at the end he took the <unk> and he threw it into the Moses -- -- you can actually see a little <unk> a <unk> a <unk> <unk> and he said, "You know, <unk> -- three <unk> <unk> What don't you do?"
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and I'll push something.
Let's start with the detection of it.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup of the World World.
Maybe some of you -- played Italy and France, and at the end, <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, I finally won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before play.
The time line is at the top.
For the early evening there are people over here and there are doing <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> in France.
You know, people do a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, <unk>
She earns Italy, <unk>
That night they all went to <unk> into the center.
There you see the big <unk>
The next day, they all went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody drove down.
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, at the time -- people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the city of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today we know all about the source of our objects.
So this is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, it, how it <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed a few small tags to track the trash in its shift in the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening complicated things and there's no need for no need.
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we <unk> not it is still somewhere on the planet.
And if the plastic bottle we <unk> a day still follows there.
What if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of <unk>
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk>
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe has a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces.
And the question was, how can the technology, the new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at the MIT, in a workshop was, imagine you have a <unk> and you get rid of the valves of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It was believed as a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you go down the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, images.
And the <unk> the curtain was going to open up so we can pass as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor of <unk>
It liked a lot of it.
And then we took a commission to design the input of the <unk>
We call it the <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no windows and no windows -- but when you get close to you, it opens up so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down your roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears as in this case.
Those days always there'll be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, go down the roof, and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you get almost all the architecture away.
Here's how it works.
You see people who go inside what happens inside.
And here I am myself trying to do the test by proving the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun in it.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building, because the way they interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was open to let me happen, but a building that kept making <unk> and <unk> and one had to jump down to not get wet.
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as a architects, engineers, designers, we always think of use that people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to <unk> that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical <unk> the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine you could have small helicopters in the air, and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud moving into space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as the one we saw before, which is moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
This kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or in three dimensions, what it changes is light, not the position of <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appear in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And that then all of that could a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can reach back to you and see it from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like that.
When the lights lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers in linear today, the star of the New York City star and <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> it captures it in different <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> in real time as motion capture.
It can <unk> the whole movement.
You can go around the way.
And once we have the pixels and we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of us <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign we <unk> we can move from the digital world, from the <unk> of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in <unk>
You can move around the inside, and have different experiences.
You can see from below, will serve to share the main moments of the Olympics Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new <unk> of London.
You can go in.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but most importantly, it will be a new experience for anybody who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, you could improve it for a more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in a better way, to get more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure of ourselves?
What about living with good health?
Or maybe those people who always want to be more creative.
What are you most <unk>
What if you could choose anything?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> You probably owe the number of creative creative people.
That's very good.
How many would you choose <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Ah, most people, that makes me feel very good as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe that is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> topic here at the TED conference but I want to give you the look at a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a trial called "Nothing in biology makes sense to the light of <unk>
But if you actually embrace biological evolution consider this: it's about the past, or the future?
refers to the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, is, of course, the most interested in us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In the 1990s, there's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the most most of the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, which is chemically <unk> which comes out of <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all take in the gut more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> is asked by the <unk> you think about the <unk>
And the gut is a wonderfully adaptive environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, dark, <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that can be able to want to be in their part.
It's really like a rapid pathway for bacteria to the occasional disruption of some <unk> <unk>
But by that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what are the future?
We're in sort of an evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something maybe better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, the life on Earth is a little bit of <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you've got it to be <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental about most of the existence of life, in <unk> organisms -- every cell simply divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two cell cells.
But when organisms come up, things start to change.
It goes into the scene sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome -- the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say the <unk> of the death of the body enters evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to <unk> that when I was a college student, I was thinking, <unk> <unk> death for <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year it was happening, I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night somebody hits your door in a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him, he finds a slight dancer.
He looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
"He's doing George, "I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you healthy.
I wanted to reclaim health in disease.
I wanted you to live more and more healthy.
Evolution consists of spending the genome on the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> designed to send the genetic burden to the next level -- and then let us fall into the sea.
I think all of the feeling that I put Allen Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily reach longevity.
It doesn't necessarily get the bigger or the stronger or the faster or even the smarter.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only survival test.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that we would find out if there were fish out there, fish fish, a void, but yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look ahead at the next stage, I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the question underlying reasoning would be that by medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us to get to us, as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we get away so much that it is no longer possible to have the necessary isolation of evolution.
A second possibility is that a evolution of traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the <unk> as a species <unk> distant planets are going to exist and the environmental changes that can produce the evolution of nature.
But there is a third possibility -- a <unk> and intriguing possibility -- intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in the decisions that we want.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First of all, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what the individual is <unk>
Just think that if you could actually choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in its own body to make the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes on your genes?
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and 13 years.
<unk> million dollars.
By the next year, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion bases of the human genome at a cost to about 20,000 and one week.
Not a lot of us to make the human genome actually make the human genome -- and be increasingly in the reach of everyone.
You come those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect ourselves but are going to induce immunity.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine in cells in a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's really today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> or change the children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate diabetes, eliminate diabetes, reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology that the same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is also going to allow us to also have <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could pull it up with the next generation of the <unk> machine.
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions of pass this into the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we wanted to have become the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that could normally take 100 thousand years and we can bring it to 1,000 years and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices to make a better society, more successful <unk>
Or, we're going to choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for anybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to face.
And the deepest of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these gut decisions.
For good or worse, and before what I could do -- these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight assistants in flying.
So I looked at it, and they said, "There is no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already cracked the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see three.
Two minutes later, three minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot took the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly, that's not the road.
It took the motors.
Imagine being in an airplane and not <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three words I have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight assistant.
I could see it in his eyes.
It's terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to come and didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I've wanted and never <unk>
As I thought about that, later on, I was a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll set it up.
I don't want to hear about anything in life.
And that urgency, that is really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is the way I <unk> the George Washington, which I wasn't very much -- I thought about, <unk> I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity also to give me place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I would get involved in things that didn't care with people that matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is what your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please be <unk>
I don't want this to be broken into 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, <unk> will be not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that whole life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not much artistic talent --   And I scream, <unk> <unk> as a small one.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point, I got to connect those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was awarded a miracle, I wouldn't die that day.
And I gave me another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live in another way.
You guys are flying around today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please not be that -- but imagine, and how you <unk>
What is it that they <unk> they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How can your negative relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're being the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many projects that have been <unk>
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important '80s.
One day he came to his home after he running and said, "Dad, I feel <unk> <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today <unk> has total paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation, and so, of course, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him, and he can be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "Wait a second, not that I have seen Stephen <unk> but not all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be important and have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate <unk>
Anybody to see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they are making them <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I showed me with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that sign a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I love her brother and with her father there at the very moment -- "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make your art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much on your inside cannot be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research Center that have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer draw on that and record negative space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle of life.
They first start with sexual <unk> then with bad words, after the attacks, and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, about a year later, after a year later, and so much move things from one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the gates of the insurance companies, and we got a machine for them to <unk> could play a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because you're talking to the guy who gets an email from it, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was bring seven programmers from all over the world from all over the corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, and kids and I, we moved to the board and these hackers and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were <unk> they would have taken off the walls of the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks later, we went to the ride. <unk> my son was part of my dog -- and I created this.
It's called <unk> and you can see the <unk>
It's a couple of <unk> sunglasses that we buy on the <unk> of <unk> Beach, some copper wire wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on a light of LED light, and there's now a device that's free -- and it builds up the <unk> we published the code <unk> the software is down in a <unk>
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company to say so."
There is no hospital I can tell you about.
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicating using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's her room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after about a year of planning, two weeks of teaching two of the night, Tony went back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and it's looking through the support system of your life.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the outside of the hospital.
And he went back to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends -- you can imagine what was the <unk>
The funny thing was that we had to bust on the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time he was six years old in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and he would take me out of there so it could be <unk>
Isn't that beautiful?
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion movements.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to get it, and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that in April of this year at the middle of Los Angeles there is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them will be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it as possible.
None of what there was in this room was possible -- the computer -- the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a moment.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> <unk> technology -- I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want all of us to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not now, let's get it, and if I'm not me, who?
Thank you, guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in most difficult situations and at the same time as much dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> difficult areas and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating only this fun in the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in great part of my career, I've been able to focus on situations everywhere with the only goal to try to look at social issues in ways that we would make attractive, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that would be made worthless and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I would come here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you can have heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered the rights of my TEDTalk TEDTalk in 2011.
What I was like, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TED TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it <unk> to you or your company doing it.
But that said this, it's a very good opportunity to <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I couldn't tell you for certain.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could do it -- nothing could do it for something as difficult or as dangerous as to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> So I want to make a film that tried to <unk> the marketing and the marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> of products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The biggest film ever ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all of the top up at the bottom, at the end, at first, has a brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title, the brand two.
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> by the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film is looking at this idea -- <unk> <unk> is what? It's <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> A <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the <unk> mark on the title but we're going to make sure we use all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe you take a shoe and get the most great shoe that you've ever had.
The most cool car you've ever driven in "The largest film ever <unk> the best <unk> that you've got from "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then also going to show the brands as part of the life, to make them <unk> the <unk> -- MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
And the goal of the full shot is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the complete idea, all the shot of principle of beginning to end.
And I would love to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how responsive the people are going to be.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money does it take to do this?
MS: A million and a half and a half <unk> <unk> -- I think it's going to be hard to the meeting with them, but it's certainly worth getting a couple of big brands to a couple of big brands here.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes to us, let's see it as a lot of <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be based on.
MS: But it's going to be hard to be <unk> by the film or to be I?
JK: And so on.
MS: So ... means you're not very optimistic.
So I love <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yes. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: So I thought that <unk> the <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these companies suddenly gone.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product as many people as possible, to make as many people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the stage of the separate media scenario is not the idea to tell with that new vehicle that's going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a mistake -- and that mistake was this.
There was actually not such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for <unk> images in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line maybe the bigger problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the president, even the <unk> the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it really something it changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives you <unk>  like that weird bear that's still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
It took an entire bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and telling them we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want them to be <unk>
We want a story, but we want to make a story, but we would say to <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father told me in some lie -- and there he is looking at me as a <unk> saying, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, is my story, and there's <unk> story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that was just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take off the developer and go to the companies I was myself with my whole team.
So what I started to figure out suddenly -- and I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: So I have friends who make big films -- huge giants and others that make small, independent films like mine.
And my friends who do big Hollywood movies that are big <unk> they say the reason their movies have so successful is because of the brands associated with it.
And then my friends who do independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the film?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview during an interview with someone I can say "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little anxious.
I want to help you <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there I offer one of these <unk> <unk>
It's both <unk> <unk> as <unk> of the <unk> they're going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for a man like for <unk> solid, <unk> <unk> as it is.
That's the general picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at it.
Karen <unk> We are a little brand.
<unk> the kind of little movies that we <unk> we are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind people -- the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
KF: That's a great question.
Volunteer: higher.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talked about something audacious, <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
You're really <unk>
How do we keep you cool longer, with better <unk> <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common guy.
I need to talk to the man in the street, people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to talk to me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what's the <unk> <unk>
<unk> -- something <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors -- a lot of gray colors and things like that.
Usually I am wearing yourself as a sunglasses, or the <unk> or the <unk>
Woman: Dan was a brand a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: It's partly <unk> in part <unk> in part -- <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of the pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: We have failed.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be a brand Tom, but I often lie on the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could enter my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that person's personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: <unk> a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of being.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: <unk> in that world.
MS: That world? And I think that your world is the world that we <unk> like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All those things come back and start in a place and in my case come back in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like the different things.
I like the weird things I like the weird stuff.
A: <unk> of <unk> to what do we do it?
What's the <unk> What is <unk> What phase you are now?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
Let's get a little bit about that.
<unk> more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
What kind of roller coaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: thank you for your patience. <unk>
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but it <unk> in your personality of <unk> the Morgan Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were <unk> very well.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only going to focus on one of your strong spots or on the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to -- and it's the nature of nature of avoiding the things that they're not <unk> to avoid fear, those items, and you actually give them something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the Apple Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and brands -- those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is something quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to take your brand, your brand, your brand, what would that be?
You're a <unk> <unk> You're somebody who makes the blood <unk>
Or are you a good attribute of a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful as being playful as <unk> contemporary <unk> or bold like <unk> <unk> quickly or <unk> <unk> dominant, magical or mystical <unk>
Or are you rather than <unk>
You're <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
You're a traditional one, <unk> <unk> <unk> you."
You're <unk> stable, familiar, certainly sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they didn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how you now use MRI to identify MRI centers in the brain both for commercial marketing as a movie for film.
We went to San Paulo where the advertising was forbidden by the air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts that companies are becoming a way in the schools with the funding problems in the U.S.
The incredible thing for me is that the projects I have had the biggest answer or the ones I've had more success is the ones I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> taken out of their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly to the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how did he gone? Did it make it success?
Well, since the film was released in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million meaning in the media to this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just <unk> no press or TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has started to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all of the agencies that we talk to you, <unk> their clients not to be a part.
I have always believed that if you take a risks, that in those risks are opportunities.
I think when you get out to the people that's pushing them to failure.
I think when you train your employees in the loss of risk is preparing their whole company for <unk>
I feel that what happens to happen to progress is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we'll move forward, I think we need to give it to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear of risk.
From a <unk> at a time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we need to support transparency.
It's more than ever a little bit of honesty is going to go through a long way.
And said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- <unk> has been introduced by my good friends in <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data data for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in behalf of the transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: This is a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED matrix, the <unk> Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my welfare next year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is <unk> <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are real-time control systems.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a effective virus from Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set this gray, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box hurts the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely <unk>
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of the <unk> the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed like to want to do something with these <unk> boxes.
That struck us attention, and we started an experiment where you infect our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they were very weird things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat who didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
It had no sense for me.
And after I experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for actively in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program which is trying to infect you are actually working on that one.
If not, <unk> doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It might be, let's say, for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found out that it was <unk> on two bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed professionally with people that obviously had all the internal information.
<unk> all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much we <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, and high technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we were able to find this sense of this code.
What we were looking at initially called functions of the system, because we know what they do.
We were looking for <unk> and data structures and we were trying to deal with the real world, with potential targets in the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To come to theories about goals of goals -- we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> must be a <unk> <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and I consulted an effort to <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
So rotor it's that cell part within the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make the <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to <unk> the nest engineers so that they could not solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> stands up in that code, you can't <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better <unk>
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts of called stages.
And guess what we found in the <unk> code.
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of trust to understand what we had in the hands.
And so it hasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to start.
Still, we found out that both digital <unk> were to one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
<unk> small is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicate with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're really confident that we have determined what is the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other goals that are <unk> by <unk>
I show you a few very interesting things that we just saw, I really hated me.
There's the gray box -- and the top is the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the values of input of sensors for example, of pressure sensors and <unk> sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, this <unk> data data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed by <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> in the room of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not work.
For example, in a power plant, when the large steam turbine goes in speed, you have to open escape tubes.
Obviously, this can't do it a human operator,
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then they can go through bad things.
The plant can explode.
And not the <unk> nor the security system <unk>
That scares it.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work also, for example, in a power plant, or in a automobile factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this load with a key <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology from worms to <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you get that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We have to face the implications, and better that we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah.
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower, right?
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give you the skills that you can take a wheelchair users and come back and start walking.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's nothing other than something that is put in the morning, gives you a big force that also increases its speed, and help, for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and connect with the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not an idea of <unk>
To show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier that, on average, you have to take on their back to a load of pounds, and it's <unk> to take more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injury on 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage on the back.
We decided to look at this challenge, and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the matter.
Let me introduce you to <unk> or <unk> Human Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can <unk> 90 pounds of land for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner, to produce this device this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So now we look at the look at the online users of the wheels, which I feel particularly <unk>
There are 68 million people running out of the wheelchair, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people, with damage to the spinal cord that when they start their life -- at 20, 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We are also talking about the population that gets older.
His only option, a lot of times -- by brain injury or some <unk> -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda 19 years ago he had Amanda following a injury in <unk> and as a result he couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> <unk>
You have some sensors.
It was completely not <unk> in the crutches who send signals to the computer computer, here on the back.
There is also some batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and make them move through this and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, for a stranger in the air, skiing across it was <unk>
In a fraction of the second, I lost all feeling and all motion from <unk> down.
Shortly after that, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You know, you never go back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
I stole up until the last bit of hope of my being.
The technology of adapting technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs out of rocks and even riding rocks and <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change future generations -- not just the soldiers, but to Amanda, and all of the chairs of chairs in the wheels, all of you.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> they practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the 21st-century Man festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos in rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest relatives closest ways.
That means we all share a common ancestor an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done so much emphasis on this way in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large -- <unk> society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where death violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest -- and it's been very difficult to be <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an Earth of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario scenario that has been sustained for decades and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction is also going to put the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting and the deforestation make it not fill with the bonobos and the bonobos left in the world -- and honestly, we are not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the laughter hidden by the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as ape <unk> the love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobo is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love playing throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us, and for them the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
With it, we learn <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience has to do with <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, of connections.
And when you look at the game play, it sees the <unk> roots of the laughter, the dance and the ritual ritual and the ritual process.
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play but I want to show you a couple of unique videos of the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young man in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk>
I just believe that in this case, he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common in bonobos as human beings.
And this video is really interesting because it shows this video that's really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> the <unk> and at the same time it's more fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> you can take a lot of forms, some of which is more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with little water <unk>
I think like her, sometimes we play ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future future, a future where we have to adapt to a more and more difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a successful world we need to play.
But let's make our capacity in the <unk>
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and human beings alike, it's not just cruel and <unk>
When you look at the least appropriate play, you can be the most urgent thing.
So partners, I have primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together as we understand creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I am not fighting poverty, it's fires like a captain of the captain of the volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers were sending them to a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high chance to go.
But still, there was a race to the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what our job was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of their life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her head, and she was standing on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before I was before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- he came back to the captain and he asked him to fit in and <unk> the owner of the owner.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, would have to tell people that I entered a burning building to save a living alive because I made me for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to go home.
I need you to <unk> <unk> fire, and he brings this woman a couple of <unk>
I promise you.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the <unk> firemen that <unk> the <unk> and entered the main room for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden around the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
We got rid of the house <unk> for home where, as he would expect, he got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the owner of the house owner for the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at over what else was that someone had reached a couple of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling as my volunteer firefighter I witnessed acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage <unk>
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
And so when I look at this room to people who have made there, or are there for -- and they're making positive levels of success I would like to remind you -- not yet.
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you get <unk>
We put food in a dining room, a <unk> park.
They're mentors.
Not every day, we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's life, but every day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So you trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I am a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks of concrete is built in <unk> with a very simple idea modules from a fixed measure that fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, as buildings or bridges -- a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> came up with this.
This was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to every home.
It's estimated that they've made more than 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be a engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the computer block -- the favorite in the world, and turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to address the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us out of a world of aesthetic bricks -- around the other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the particular block -- the transistor allows us to create much bigger and more complex circuits a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't think about it, that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they're joining together by magnets.
So you can't put it wrong.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> and the orange color is <unk>
So you only have to assemble a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue one with a green one, make light.
We can put a button in the environment, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse module that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make you <unk> faster or faster, simply turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection growing.
We want all the interactions in the world <unk> bricks to use.
<unk> sound, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For instance, how does a night light, or why the door of an elevator is kept open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also taken the design schools.
So for example, designers without expertise in electronics start playing <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>
Here's an example of a project that has done, an island of <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is a <unk> <unk>
For these engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all of the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world, is ours.
So I'll go ahead and make up.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is to get involved with the environment focusing on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I have a term like time?
All right. Thank you very much.
So a couple of years ago I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do: we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
We took some members every year, and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World of the World -- we send them to wildlife <unk>
They made big <unk> worked with the employees <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of technology today.
Think of <unk>
This is a trailer in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I were looking for a quote, but what it really looks for is that somebody else gets it, when he was trapped by snow, because he knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time -- a lot last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that the citizens we have with shovels the sidewalks right in front of them.
So it did as a great programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice app that you can adopt a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can <unk>
Now, it has a component uprising.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications -- last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads viral.
A responsible deal of systems in the city of <unk> to see this application realized that it could use it, not to snow, but for citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> <unk> but people steals the batteries.
And so he asks the citizens that <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just launched it to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know nine cities that plan to use it.
And this has been spread without <unk> in organic and natural fashion.
If you know about government technology, you know this doesn't happen.
The software acquisition is usually a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us to have done by the normal channels would have taken at least two and 10 million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the court power of California that until the moment has taken over 2,000 billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an application that shows a couple of days and it spreads in a viral form is a kind of teacher shooting at the institution of government.
It suggests to the best ways of working, not as private businesses, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in the open and <unk> fashion.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way we address the question of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a problem of collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good at collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to make them together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country who contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
They feel a lot of frustration to that but they don't <unk> it.
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that you make us crazy, the government is, in essence, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they don't <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, you would ask you, because things are changing.
The politics is not <unk>
And because the government ultimately grows of -- you remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way it is to think about how to make change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make people <unk>
Well, after two years, I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly about <unk>
This is the heart of telephone care and information.
It's the place that serves calls if you make a brand on the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the official knowledge base.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open up the doors of the house, and put music up and see if it <unk>
And it worked. So it's okay for Scott.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston is not a call center.
It has a application, and a mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
They didn't get that app.
It was the work of very clever people from the Bureau of New York Office of Boston.
One day, this is actually coming up with this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of waste.
How do I do to <unk>
The <unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so you all see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I came up with the place, I found the trash cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of the income income to private collaboration,
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean by the definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to join each other and help others.
So a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
I connected to two people.
And I could have connected to the government services of being necessary, but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than government services.
When one neighbor helps another one, <unk> the communities.
If we call the control control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but think that one is the input of the other.
So our input to the government system is <unk>
How many times have you chosen a <unk> leader -- sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government is going to save our values and leverage our needs but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the <unk> superficial layer.
On the bottom is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> which keeps us from that that we were funded as something that is working on our against that other thing, and in a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy <unk>
Because it's where the real job of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk>
This is a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report, 325 pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> us to the government, it's time for us to ask, what world do we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't <unk> the government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows it's not so difficult to act -- we just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The age of our members is 28 years old, so I me, <unk> I'm a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to talk about who you're going to talk about.
They can express their opinions on any channel at the same time, and they do.
So when you face the government problem they don't care a lot about their voices.
They're using hands.
They put their hands into the work to program applications that do to work better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be washing a fire hydrant, taking out a bucket of junk that has a <unk>
Of course, we could always have <unk> those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not just consumers, we're not just consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that; we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the citizen of citizenship.
So I want to ask everybody when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we'll be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and <unk>
I've spent most of my life in the communities in the living communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED looking at and hearing these stimulation has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that they say here are impact on the whole world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have a different way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach yourself with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A physician can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in the practice of right, my work.
I learned my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was <unk> it was strong, it had power.
It was the last word in all the discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
He was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way I saw the world.
She was <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was small and looked at it, she was approaching me and I gave me a good person.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then get it out.
One or two hours later, I came back to <unk> and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I would give me back again and if I said yes, I was going to put me in peace.
He had this human quality that would always wish to be near it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of 10.
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and their attention.
My cousins were running around the place.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first, I thought it was a game.
And I looked at her and he smile, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up through the room, took me from the hand and said, "Come on. We are both going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, "You know, I will tell you something, but you can't tell anyone you can say it."
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I didn't think so. I said, <unk>
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
And then he said to me, "Just do I want you to take three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
Like me <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk>
And then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to do is you will always do the right thing, although the right thing to be <unk>
And I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to do is you never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk>
I grew up in the field, in rural <unk> I have a brother a bigger year and a sister one younger year.
When I was 14 or 15, 15, one day my brother came home with a six-year-old package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We just got to do the <unk> of the usual day.
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little and offered me.
I said, "No, no, no. That's okay. You're <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, "You know, today I do it." And you always do the same as we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I didn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother stood at me.
And he said, "What's going on? You take a <unk>
I went through the <unk> look at the <unk> and <unk> "Oh, not to be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren who are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably doesn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is going to think it's a <unk> I say it by the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that they really don't make any sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been prisoner during the <unk>
My guys died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to her, we should be <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the highest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people at parole.
And this mass incarceration in my view, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities or black communities find so much <unk> so much despair determined by these facts.
One in three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or at parole.
In urban <unk> urban <unk> in urban <unk> Los Washington, 50 to 60 to 60 percent of all the color young people are in jail or at parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is affecting the results.
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not ours.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some of the developments a few of the developments that are quite curious.
In Alabama, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you know, whether you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years the level of loss of rights will be as high as you were before they <unk> the law of the right-hand line.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The U.S. is the only country in the world where they were 13 to 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country in jail for children, without a chance to go out.
Now we're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They were talking to people in the death row.
This case of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, we have asked ourselves to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for crimes -- but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death penalty is defined by mistake.
Out of nine people who have identified it has been identified as innocent who is <unk> and released from death row.
A <unk> rate <unk> an innocent in every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation wouldn't they ever be able to fly airplanes if every nine than <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students in the history of <unk> I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the rebuilding and it lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
He worried about being <unk>
The terror of terror was what they defined his lives.
Now there are people bigger people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach talks, <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with terrorism, after the first time with terrorism.
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with <unk> and decades of racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we're going to get together with others.
We are constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that we could not overcome racial <unk> without a compromise and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures on death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation, and he said, "You know it's very disturbing to listen to what we <unk>
<unk> "We have no death row in Germany.
<unk> we can never be here."
The room was quiet and a lady said, "There is no way that with our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we and <unk> and <unk> we put people <unk>
Let's get on this.
How do we cling in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We couldn't get it out.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these hard issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
It fascinated us the technology. <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, these realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my view, we need to integrate both of them.
I've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment commitment to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> that never come to TED.
And if you think about them it is, in a way, something that's inside our self.
We really have to believe in issues that we haven't seen before.
So we are, despite being so rational, so committed to the intellectual <unk>
With innovation, with innovation, development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from ideas coming from ideas also for the heart of the heart.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in the East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, guidance for spirit, a will for being in space sites, and being <unk>
Well, that guidance for spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no <unk> related to technology and design, that allowed us to truly be humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to poverty, to <unk> inequality, by injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we know these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women are together just to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> was called me to say, <unk> comes the old lady. We're going to get together to talk.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going to go and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. <unk> went to me and said, "Now, you have me show me this is that idea of <unk> justice.
<unk> what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end the sentences for life, without freedom hanging down for children.
We try to do something about the death penalty of death.
We try to reduce the population on prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> got a finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very <unk> but very <unk>
I think the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find ways to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated on simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each of us is higher than we have <unk>
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to it, it's not a <unk>
But even if someone kills another, it's not that it's a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in people who should be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
This is not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think even though it is very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> <unk> we don't have to judge our technology by our design or our own intellectual capacity or rational.
By the end of a society, the character of a society, not the way they treat rich rich, powerful people, but in the way they treat the poor, we prescribe them.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do so much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been convicted of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients in 13 and 14 years who have been <unk> so they were <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge can turn someone into what is not it?
The judge will <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
A very late night I was wake up with my God, if the judge can become something that you don't are, it must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should be asking for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 years old, a tiny, poor, poor, white.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> <unk> is treated like a <unk> white <unk> from a <unk>
In the <unk> I found that there were a behavioral conduct in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there's no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking about that <unk> they would have a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> it had sent the cut.
It was about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to cut this case stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I was in the courthouse.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally dropped out of the car <unk> to court.
I was going up the stairs when I came up with a black man named <unk> the courthouse.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you. He said yes.
And so I got confused and <unk>
And I would tell me in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected deeply with my interior, with my identity that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I walked into the room of audiences.
By getting in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this <unk> <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> I went back to argumentation.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They came the cops the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people -- I was <unk> because we were talking about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I went to see the <unk> that I was and <unk>
I looked at the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and for there.
Finally, this old black, with the face of worry, walked in the room and sat behind me, almost on the interview table.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break, a <unk> assistant was upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> ran over the old black one.
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black guy stood up and looked at me and he looked at me and he said, <unk> this room of audiences to tell this young man who keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we can't really be able to fail if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our technology of technology, design and creativity and creativity have to get rid of the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> of hearing and seeing an obvious desire to the audience, in this community, to help you do something.
Something that's not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you're going to be an effort to <unk> the funds you spend today in political policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars worth of death, in the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> cases were not <unk> in <unk>
They don't arrive at anything.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are <unk> these funds to get the law to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, is that it has to do with the highest <unk> rate.
What would you say to the ones you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in massive <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war.
That's why this dramatic increase in the population <unk>
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to take people to the supply chain, to rob a bicycle, for small crimes against ownership instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> Do you <unk> you guys today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for coming to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media means they prefer negative news, because our minds pay attention to.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day, our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters to us more than survive, the first stop of all of those data is an ancient piece of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that I could possibly hurt us.
So from a <unk> stories -- to look at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there are blood, it's very true.
And given that all digital devices are giving us negative news -- seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, not wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it doesn't.
Maybe, instead of change, what's really happening is we got <unk>
Perhaps huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
Now, I'm not saying we don't have our good issues -- climate change, the climate change, the scarcity of water and <unk> no doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long run, we just had them.
Let's take what's happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average income per capita is adjusted by inflation in the entire world.
Child mortality has reduced by 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the world literacy has gone from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to <unk>
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> <unk> mobile phones.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> the <unk> the planet would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It's a lot of this technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that I would put into information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and double the price performance in about 12 to 24 months.
For that reason the mobile phone in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things at this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time, in war and peace, in the recession, in the recession, in the <unk>
It's the speed of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly fast.
And in this curve, to Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computation on the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing, sensors and networks, 3D printing and networks, 3D printing and networks, 3D printing and fuels all over the planet, synthetic biology, and fuels and food, the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" from Watson, <unk>
It was spade.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline to <unk>
And I love this this: <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
<unk> with the nuances of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everybody in the phone.
Four years ago, at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already been done.
When I think of creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> of the planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that it's <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon Three of the 1800s.
He's the kind of the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason, the tip of the Washington Washington is aluminum.
You see, although the aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a <unk>
It's tied by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and made the aluminum something so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
<unk> this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about energy supply.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 percent of power every 88 minutes.
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, the solar power will cost six cents a <unk> compared to 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed up to the Voyager spacecraft to Earth, in 1990, after it happened.
He was a famous picture -- how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, and the two percent is saltwater, and we fought for the <unk> of the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology that's available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to give you your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small fridge size.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water on the day of any source -- saltwater, water <unk> a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought to make a major test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that goes well, and I have full confidence that it would be, Coca-Cola has to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an integral innovation for this technology that today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that Irish warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smartphone with Google, he has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton does 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have predicted before.
Better than that, the things that you and I paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video images, images of books and music, <unk> technology and music technology, <unk> and they lose value value with mobile phones.
Maybe you get the best thing to get when you look at the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the world teams to make these technologies in a mobile device with the ones that talk, and because it has <unk> they can be extracted blood from <unk>
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there is no doctors, where the <unk> charge is about 25 percent, and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that we don't want to call the health <unk> and, first of all, avoiding the epidemic.
But this is the greatest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the one billion increase.
The white lines here are the population.
We've just spent the brand of the seven billion <unk>
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected to it.
By 2020, it'll come from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds of mind before <unk> that you add up to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you get? What wishes.
And instead of an economic collapse we have the greatest economic injection of the story.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars <unk> in the global economy.
And so thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of print in 3D and computing in the cloud of cloud they'll be more productive than ever before.
What can they give us three billion more members of humanity, healthy healthy and <unk>
How about some voices never before ...
What if we give them to <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and be able to act for the first time?
What did these three billion?
And if they are <unk> we can't get <unk>
One thing I learned with the X Prize, is that small teams guided by her passion with a goal, of course, they can do things that could only make great corporations and the governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you already know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids, and figure out how to fold protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with these university teachers, each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined up and started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better <unk> protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power as people to take on the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovator of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion different minds that we have to get together to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I will give you three examples to make time.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
They actually set up fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It was a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets still says they keep <unk>
So what's going on here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a pond, in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned very much with the sun, and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The Lagos was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, of a <unk>
There were <unk> about 20 inch, the <unk> of black beard <unk>
And the fish of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made more than half in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later the number of fish had dropped in half.
I went to the five inches.
It was a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy about being there.
Anyway, nothing to changed, but it's all changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- I mean, I started in <unk> Europe conducted a lot of developing projects.
<unk> development was supposed to impose in the countries that were already 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, quite ugly, <unk> called <unk> four.
I went out to fish on him, and we did studies in southern China <unk> and, above all, in the <unk> Sea.
So what we capture in there, was a <unk> thing.
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
90 percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most fish are blobs of a little bit about <unk> the remains of coral reef fish.
In short, the sea bottom came to cover and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start the commercial fishing.
The background happens to be a solid background of soft coral in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Don't <unk> them because they were dead.
I was once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to be <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect fishermen every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But it hasn't been <unk>
We don't remember it.
They <unk> the start point, at the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, the amount of <unk> <unk> the country, the water supply.
And that changes with time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and then extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive the loss.
They don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the exploration of changes.
And in the end, keeping a few <unk> remains.
And that, in large measure, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies die, they kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose ordinary animals.
Even if this isn't perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous with great fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
We have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they'll do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not the way they would expect to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of us would be able to start as a captain of the captain that captain could not be used or just looked at a lot of the fish in this area that can't be used or, generally they don't use the scientists from fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in living societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
There is a huge paper that can be a protected area.
Because with marine areas -- we actually really recreated the past.
It <unk> the past that people cannot conceive of, because the starting point has been running, and it's extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected area and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like people in the Midwest, for example?
I think there is the arts and cinema maybe you can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation simulation of the <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay 500 years ago.
And you might have noticed that the nuances and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think of <unk> if you think about what people were touched with the film <unk> to talk about the history of <unk> why do we <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
And so my <unk> the only one to give, is <unk> <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm an Kevin <unk> <unk> <unk> manager and looking at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are making a viral virus and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed a very, very difficult thing.
But today, the website today makes any of us, or our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Any one can be made on the Internet in a <unk>
You climb over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, just a small percentage is actually getting a myriad of visits and makes a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: the creators of trends, communities and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this film filmed outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the popularity of popular last summer.
<unk> was not saying to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if you call <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this poignant <unk> to the <unk>
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> present us and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, you have to start a Friday.   You all want you to get the end of week, the weekend.   You will not think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
Rebecca <unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos in the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be arisen from nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, he was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> you are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and lots of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people in making a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that a person or a group of creators have a point of view, and they share it with a larger public audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this big internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
So just in the first seven days, there was a parody for every single one of the other days.
Unlike the 20th century, unlike the 20th century, this community engagement is our way of being part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an underwater animation, with a <unk> music.
That's like this, that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a three hours of three hours that has seen four million times.
Even cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that I woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version of the ancient one.
And then it was international <unk>
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> or Rebecca <unk> or Rebecca <unk> <unk>
What script could have been written that <unk> this situation?
In a world that you climb up two days of video for minute, just the only thing and unexpected can be <unk> so that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind of protest against the <unk> in New York, I'm going to admit that I wasn't really interested in it.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you physically from the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise effect and its humor, Casey <unk> made it that five million watched and understand her idea.
So this approach is worth all of the new things we do differently.
And all of this leads to a big question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend, creative communities of participation, all the unexpected, are features of a new kind of culture, which we all have access to and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said before, one of the most celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They can't afford permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media features -- are hardly the current media today, but they <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
So words, for so much time -- I am <unk>
You get involved in silence.
He died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that ever have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was tried to <unk> but I did it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> overnight.
My mother, <unk> was so only 18 years old when his father died, and marriage marriage and two girls.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task, the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that I couldn't do this.
And after a <unk> of four years that challenges the fiction, a boat was beaten up to the sea dressed as <unk> ship.
All of the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was the pills the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we were asked by first we would take my sister and my sister and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, <unk> <unk> in every wave, and the vast and vacuum.
I don't remember pirates that came several times, but that they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to initiate for six hours.
But I do remember the lights from the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and a young man who collapsed and died, end the journey was too much for it, and the first apple that I tried -- because of the men of the platform.
No apple had later the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations to shape a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of class class, whose population is composed of immigrants from immigrants here.
Unlike the middle class of class, the existence of the middle class, which I was <unk> in <unk> no sense of the right.
The odor that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English was being traded between people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a degree in <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and an extra <unk> in English and math, you wouldn't mind what she should be <unk> that was generally <unk> it was always a second hand.
Two pairs of average for school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform until the <unk> because I had to last six years old.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something about me <unk>
He was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we got rid of our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until their nightmares would start to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer shop, then I studied to be <unk> and he opened a different business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the angry and <unk> boys and boys who were trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, I was the classic <unk> student, <unk> with what I was talking about myself.
On the other hand, it was <unk> in <unk> products, <unk> by violence and drug abuse and insulation.
But many of them got help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer who was elected by Australian young year.
And I went <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges don't <unk>
And so <unk> resident anonymously in <unk> was right now as <unk> refugee and social activist who were invited to speak in sites that had never heard of <unk> and houses whose existence had never ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat at the way and the comfort of life in a suburb -- a grandmother -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and running <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age as she had when we got the ship.
Neither had ever been an option.
<unk> he said, "What don't you do?"
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
And the more frankly speaking, the more I was talking about, most it was <unk> to speak.
I met people of all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were living on the border of possible.
And although I finished my thesis I realized I couldn't stay in a career race.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's good to be a stranger, new in the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being in it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that, yes, that the world <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> they didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was one energy there, an optimism <unk> a mixture of humility and courage.
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a small group of people who the slogan cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, it was a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
They <unk> until the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but a few brilliant, and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single trip.
My <unk> again.
Three months later there was <unk> and <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
At 17 it became <unk> from a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of her husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and to take the cause she itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't do it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in a hotel in <unk> when she was killed, <unk> <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw her standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell him, and we made sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise her hand.
I asked her to the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"Not have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us who were and how life gets us, we can now see the men that would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would have easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could wish that to know?
But I'm afraid to the privilege of the easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave in every wave, the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to them and watch safe I would do.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is now here, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the former Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and drop the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
And in that time, when you get the great Indian warrior of the Indian warrior of the Indian warrior he had <unk> he pulled out a bow and with a <unk> on the ground, could get water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that blew my mind.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give me this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that the technology had to allow the magic -- not <unk>
As a child my grandfather gave me his father's silver <unk>
And this piece for 50 years was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with images of pirates and <unk> in my imagination.
I had a sense that the mobile phones, the luxury clocks and the cameras keep out of it.
<unk> our inspiration.
And so I came up with me -- I threw myself into this technological world to see how it would use to create magic, rather than <unk>
I took books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a device that is able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where we are.
And we put the text with the image, and animation and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what do we do it?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so --   He says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In a few times I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- which is led to me.
My inner girl gets excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but the magic of childhood to those ideas that I could try with children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned out to me.
So over here, we have to <unk> the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually, they light up your way to what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy <unk> in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world turns into a <unk> that I would move into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all fantasy books, there have always been <unk> but static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect to me is to create Indian content and rather contemporary content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people were out of India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras, for millennia, on an old and damp book.
That's why we're bringing them back into a child <unk>
In a story that deals with current issues as the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that kids have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out the outside, take the camera or iPad, and iPad, and collect images from different natural objects.
When I was a little girl, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, and <unk>
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to reclaim this entire childhood ritual we have to go out and in a chapter, which is a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex, and then you get it out.
This way it was created a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A picture of London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Inside of the variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book we have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on the video, and the video is on and by using augmented reality, it sees a bunch of cartoons that appear inside the inside of the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves with leaves here.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and you have to be able to read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where the forces of nature is linked with technology and magic and technology to come to each other.
We sell the power of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and to that magic, <unk> <unk> that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at <unk> University was <unk> a listening.
And not a very scientific way, she stood up a little coffee cup or you and I asked patients, family and <unk> What do you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi <unk> It's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> <unk>
Every morning I <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple that every time I get involved in, it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time when you need to <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have over 4,000 Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my <unk> Wi-Fi and before I got up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's the pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From next week to be available to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would take them from their houses, take their pressure, <unk> their doctor, to share it with others, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to control and become the ship of their own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges we face as the firing of the cost of <unk> attention to the demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share with you with a video with you.
We all have navigation controls in the <unk>
Maybe even we have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> <unk> are.
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> for <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, you sometimes open up at <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use your cell phone cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we wish <unk> globally.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> it can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I'd also invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
You could be <unk> service services, for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in its place.
Please <unk> this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that you can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed with my earlier passion for the drawing of it, but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk>
To me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that starts to press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very narrow road <unk>
But he has an unexpected turn.
And yet, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures of them as dark and colorful and colorful with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say pollination, I mean <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want it to be captured in some way like photography.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem true.
Are you the details or the <unk>
ask light?
What is it that creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is a perspective.
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think it's realistic.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways they can create something that still looks like <unk> as if we exist.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So, <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic I think they're those in which we don't even get the things around us in our daily lives.
But by combining pictures is very important -- because otherwise something is going wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will keep making realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not quite special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the <unk> photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two images are done with these <unk> they were taken from the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the picture.
So here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom part of it is <unk>
But this picture is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
And in the staff I think it's easier to create a place that will find because you don't need to put the ideas on your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this time in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured in a fishing journey.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a rock.
And yes, even I made a red <unk> the top of the island of the island to make it look more <unk>
So to achieve a realistic outcome, I think it takes planning to do.
You start with a <unk> an idea.
Then we combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures of the outcome, you can be very beautiful and you can get a <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide on technology, very boring.
Please can you care?
It's a diagram that I took from a folder of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the general picture.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of microprocessors which is against the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one as many other we tend to see, is a kind of straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves.
Here's something strange here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights up.
<unk> more intensity because writing on paper.
Why do we make tech curves on evolutionary scales.
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to give you the diagram -- this would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you ask for example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very silly, and we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, you give a change that happens to change.
If the technology of transportation technology is as fast as <unk> past tomorrow we could take a <unk> and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go down to that rhythm.
There's no unprecedented in the history of technological development of technological growth that every few years dramatically orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- looking at these <unk> curves. We see that they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
So let's get one of two things.
Or it's okay to become a typical curve. I know how to come up with something completely different, or maybe it will do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, what is that new form that embraces the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future happening in 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future remains the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, across my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
We can feel it.
And we know it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is so different that we extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that, I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at things in the long term.
The time scale I would like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back about two and a half a half billion years when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with many chemicals that are <unk> around it.
If we look at the way that we organized those chemicals we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there is theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, it had floating around with some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside its inside.
Some of those droplets of oil had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside and so droplets grew up grew up.
And they began to divide.
And in some sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms, those oil <unk>
But those droplets were not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time they <unk> it <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that <unk>
That's why each <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, drops that in some way become better at the time of bringing <unk> chemicals grew more chemicals and more <unk>
Mostly, more time, they were <unk>
It was a form of life, very simple chemistry, but things would become interesting when these droplets learned the trick of abstraction.
So somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this particular evolution of writing that allowed them to register what they were to be able to register what they were so <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable to have remained stable for two and a half billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> We can write things with this code.
I have 100 <unk> white dust that I try to hide at the airport.
But I <unk> Tom this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data into this piece of DNA and I'll read it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants to want 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread for the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy another billion years ago.
But then another great step of the interesting step in which things were <unk> very different and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So, for example, it evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way of avoiding penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication led to the communities that in a way, were together in it, and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or that if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community would become more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came together so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write a whole recipe for the community board in a string of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another one billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities who have trained communities in many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscle or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than the cell phone, which we call a living organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they wouldn't make more that we process information in the community.
It's brain structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those mobile cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and conveying information.
Those were brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not at the time period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn how to eat some fruits because he knew bad and got sick the last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of a living organism that had previously built these information processing structures that would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit <unk>
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures that accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution might now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals found the trick of communication.
So, for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea.
I'm here sitting here sitting here emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a kind of vague and vague idea, in their heads that holds some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated -- we turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to begin to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to perform abstractions.
We now spend through similar periods of organisms to <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing methods.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> computer tape -- the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where we had some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the history that I told you took over a billion years each.
The next few steps the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The ones, the language and so on, took less than a million years.
And the ones, like electronics, like electronics, it seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that means its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my product designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that job for <unk> would not be possible without the recent computer advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to behave in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine <unk>
There are billions.
Instead of that, with the <unk> designers, <unk> we think of a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that makes something that we did before it goes much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we use methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please a computer, you can run a hundred million sequences of instructions to chance?
You could run these random random sequences to run all those programs, and take those that are <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order a numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely to have random random sequences of instructions, so none of them did it.
But once luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that did <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now we need the best to ordered the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and the children are <unk> the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs product from the combinations of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat <unk>
Listen to it again.
I set up some mutations here.
And it tries again and try to get it back with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in language cases in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are going to make numbers absolutely perfect.
In fact, they are much more efficient programs than the ones I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to run this to see how they work.
They're dark programs, strangers.
But they do it.
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were able to do.
In fact, their lives are dependent on this.
I once went in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer <unk> flight doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when you become complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make process of good design.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
We now use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much faster.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant about our part that we think we're the final product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of what is coming here.
But now comes lunch and I think stop here before I get stuck.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've got enough time to let me give up part of my false <unk> on that.
Before we treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We are close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to come out with the <unk> talking about the statistics and use them to form a big baseball team.
I'm focusing on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called <unk>
And we talk about 300 of a <unk> that I ate 300.
That means <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and anyone who tried to throw it into the first base, not to get time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three 10.
You know how to call a <unk> in the Big <unk>
Well, you know, maybe the team of stars.
You know how to call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody that 10 <unk> <unk> four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the League <unk> League of <unk> in a regular season in a regular season in a regular season in a regular season in a regular season in a regular season in a regular season in a regular season in a regular season in a regular season in a regular season in a regular season in a regular season in a
Now I take this into my world of medicine where I feel much more <unk> or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're byproducts to be a <unk> surgeon in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place away, and a dear to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor derived from a cardiologist whose record is <unk> it's <unk>
But do you know something?
She's pretty much better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you.
What do you think that you should be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk>
<unk> very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in the whole medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is <unk> the world, and I would include the <unk> of being perfect.
They would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> to a blood test.
Just like that.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the Afghan Hospital in the General of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of <unk> the frequent addiction and not alone.
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was pretty well; I graduated from <unk>
And I think about the school of medicine with the impression that if you did everything, then I would know everything, or as possible, close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here in Toronto when they brought the lady to the emergency room where I worked for me.
At the time, I was assigned to <unk>
And when I applied to a cardiologist I was going to go to that patient.
And reporting the chief of the residents.
When I saw the <unk> lady was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when <unk> I heard a sound sound on both sides, which gives me a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to your lungs, these are <unk> and so there's a difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I <unk>
I gave aspirin and medication.
I gave him <unk> <unk> so that I could get liquid off.
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I felt very good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more errors.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of the residents.
I didn't wake up the phone and I did what I should have done, which was calling my boss and <unk> with him for <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that <unk> lifelong attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take care of my patients without even telling my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send it to his house, he didn't take attention to a voice in my inner side that said, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so unsure that until I asked the nurse to <unk> the lady <unk> <unk> who is fine if you go to your <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was that he wrote the high and sign the ambulance together with the ambulance in her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in our stomach.
But I kept on my work.
At the end of the day, I would go to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. At that moment I did something I don't normally do normally, at that point.
I went to the emergency emergency service of the way home.
And there is another nurse, not that I was talking about the lady <unk> before, but another one. He told me three words, those three words that most doctors in emergency <unk>
Other specialists who fear fear too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it's that we see the patients.
The three words are: <unk>
"It remember the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and back to the edge of death.
By the time of an hour of having come to her house, after I gave the high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance people brought in the emergency room with a blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock to a shock of a shock to it.
I just breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all their resources.
They gave them medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk> artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because then the <unk> was in intensive care therapy and waiting for all the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days of course it was clear that they never <unk>
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they would become what was going on.
And the ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. <unk> wife, <unk> and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
And the weeks on, I went through it and experienced for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt lonely, isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't <unk> with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
The shame I'm talking about is that it makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that would feel.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure we would get the things out and made sure that I don't get paid.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did I submitted it to your home?
And in my worst point, why did I made an error so <unk>
Why did I chose <unk>
Little to a little bit of that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day, <unk> opened the sky and finally came out the sun, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with me in which if you ask the efforts to be perfect so they don't make more mistakes, make away those voices.
And he did.
I went back to work.
But it turned back to happen.
Two years later, it was for the emergency department in a community hospital in the Indian hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a 25 year-old man in the throat.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her throat, was a little bit <unk>
He <unk> penicillin and sent him home.
But while he ran to the door kept pointing out his throat.
Two days later, when I came to do my own guard, my head asked to speak with me <unk> in his office.
And I made the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and I had no <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can see it in Google -- it's an infection, not the throat, but it's going to slow down, and that it can cause the closing of those tracks.
he, fortunately, not <unk>
And he looked at her antibiotics for <unk> and <unk>
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and I went back to work, until it happened and over again, and over again.
Two times in the same shift.
And it's a big effort, especially to work in a hospital, because they get to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of them.
And it turned out an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out a colleague that was checking out the patient -- a certain piece of sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to him.
I looked at it and to see some sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, called the surgeon.
Both were operated on <unk> and they recovered well.
But every single case, I would tell me, <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and like a lot of colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most significant ones have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't tell you about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would walk into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When did the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after there'll failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well as a <unk> in my hospital I had the wrong leg of it, believe it would have a hard thing to look at the eyes.
This is the system we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> which are making mistakes that make mistakes and those who don't sleep and the ones that I know are <unk> and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, as a antibodies that starts attacking that person.
We have the idea that if you take care of medicine to people who make mistakes, will be a safe system.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years, about <unk> and medical journalism, I have made an ordinary medical study and mistakes to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the Toronto Trek to my <unk> <unk> Black Black <unk> white, white art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happen in which one in 10 drugs will be wrong, or the <unk> is not correct. In a system where bacterial infection are increasingly more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, 24,000 Canadian for errors <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is just about every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
<unk> <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain -- comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath of alcohol, and, suddenly, my story <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't get their symptoms always the same way.
That's why mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get rid of us, and we eliminate all the professionals prone to mistake, well, I'm not going to get anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, <unk> art, is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the ambulance guys to the head of <unk> <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah, "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone to them.
And their students got <unk> <unk> <unk> their head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> to say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical <unk>
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The medical <unk> is human, they know how they accept it, and they don't get their mistakes, but it's trying to learn from what happened to teach others.
They were taking their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They will give up the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way and of support for all of us <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a medical doctor.
I'm a human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel a lot of fun but effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I still don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
Recently I did a survey to more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to pick an American American.
Not a long ago, in a research followed for a week to a group of gang employment.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of these executives and the time that we are doing in making choices about those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs per week.
Naturally, every job involved lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think of your choices.
Do you know how many belong to the age of nine minutes, how many of the <unk>
How do we <unk> the way that those decisions?
I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> choosing to the overload of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and of some solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When you ask a question, you know, I'm blind, just if you want to burn calories.
Another way, when your answer is positive -- please give you a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, are ready to hear about the problem of the overload of <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, I took this <unk> <unk> <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
It was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the water -- and this was when we were getting water from the <unk>
I loved going to that shop, but on one occasion, I asked me, why never buy nothing?
This is the shelf <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in box <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and asked him, <unk> this strategy of offering all of these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists that would come every day, usually with his cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment. This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of classes.
They got a post to <unk> just the entrance to the store.
We put out of six <unk> or from 24,000 different flavors -- and we looked at two things: First of all, what if people were willing to test the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a 60 dollars that when there was only six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
So here we find the opposite effect.
From those who stopped when there was only three percent of them got to buy <unk>
When there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, they had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six that if they were found 24.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably have a good thing to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices are affecting in good decisions.
We decided to do not decide, even when this doesn't bother us.
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see people's choices for retirement of about a million Americans, in between a million plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funding <unk> available savings for retirement, to retirement, the program <unk> <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
And we found that the bigger the number of funds were <unk> there was less participation.
So if you look at the extreme ends, we see that in the plans that they offer two funds, the rate of participation was about 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that I offered to give up 60 funds, the rate of participation went to the 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more options, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to participate, the greater the number of options, more people are being transferred to avoid their actions or hedge funds.
As soon as there were more options, they were more willing to invest in financial bank accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we have to optimize to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences of the greatest and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we would make the decision that <unk> even though this is going on against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick things out less <unk> even though you objectively go better.
The main reason is that we were looking at that variety of giant <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, a contrast to that amazing <unk>
Today I want to take you to you about four simple techniques that we have <unk> in a way or another, in different research, so they can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've never heard before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than today.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in <unk>
But what we're looking at is more and more of what we're looking at is that if you choose to cut, get rid of bizarre choices -- there will be an increase in sales sales, we have a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> we eliminated the products for <unk> that less <unk> increased the <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and lower costs.
You know that the emergency room is today, on average, offer 45,000 products.
In a Walmart shop you have about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the world today is <unk> and it offers just 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce on tin.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have come over how to handle the best choices is the <unk> of David <unk> the Harvard.
All of the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a safe pool of life.
The people who really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All options are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask <unk> <unk> the differences you have between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before we started this session, I talked to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience on a holiday on the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to take it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds for <unk> and then I want you to give you a quick hand if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> applause) Okay. Anybody who are ready to accept the deal.
Isn't it more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually reached more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first <unk> than in the second, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were made more real.
This brings me to the second technique to drive the problem of the overload of choices, which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between options, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very specific ways.
Why do people spend 15 percent more on average when it uses debit cards or credit that when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that it can be more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> staff, which was working on <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> into a <unk> plan.
In that meeting that we would find exactly as a <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was we asked the staff to think about the positive things that they would put in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their bank accounts.
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study we did in a studio of magazines.
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> along the corridor of <unk> the magazine exhibition can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Okay. Well, there are some of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This rating scheme is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something that we <unk> not when we <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funding.
I would say who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think of, if you just throw it a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity of complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very good decision -- they buy a car.
This is a German car manufacturer that allows us to completely <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to put your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each other.
<unk> outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is causes the order that makes the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go out of many options, 56 colors, a few <unk> four boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go out of a few options, four <unk> <unk> lots of choices.
And what am I going to do?
How involved you are.
If you <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're being lost.
We found that the ones that go from many choices to days -- <unk> the default button and again, and another more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they go there.
The same information, the same number of choices.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order in which information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although you pick the box of change that doesn't tell you anything about the preferences of the decoration.
We're excited about a product that we're building now has more engaged in the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the overload of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternatives -- to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who work for them.
It is that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful about <unk>
And the more careful to be in our choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the '90s, in East Germany, <unk> if you had a writing machine that was supposed to get to the government.
I had to register a piece of text text written with the machine.
And this is why the government could track the origin of the <unk>
If they found a written message with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West I don't think that somebody could do this, so much that we would have the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and print on one page, that page will end up having a few yellow dots on each page that follow a pattern that makes you own one and his printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can upload the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups here.
Are you <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to earn a lot of money, huge amounts of it.
There are really many cases of online <unk> online, <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media through free <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy them in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a <unk> computer.
The secret service of the United States is about two months ago, <unk> the account <unk> of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say today is more likely to be the victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going on the worse.
In the future, most crimes was online online.
The second group of <unk> that we see today is not motivated by money.
There's another thing that moves, and they motivate them the protests, they motivate you about laughter.
Anonymous is like Anonymous has gone down in the last 12 months occupying a major paper in the line.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals that make it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous that do it for protest and the last group are the national United States governments that we have.
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an <unk> authority of the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
They got the safety of the site and a <unk>
I asked last week I asked representatives of the Dutch government, asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> the death of people who are causing the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how did people die from an attack of these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do you serve the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except for a foreign European authority.
<unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters headquarters the secret secret police headquarters in April, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes of a company based on Germany that had been sold by the Egyptian government and <unk> the communications of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool by 280 euros to the government <unk>
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the government tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, he found <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
<unk> the Internet connection.
Even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me, because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do that.
And that argument makes no sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, whatever the right people today will be forever.
They were blind to any future government, in a administration.
These are the questions we need to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, the background, and behind the cows, the National National Park.
The National Park of Nairobi has no fences in most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate to freely outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, they follow them, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that they killed by the night, and so soon we were going to wake up in the morning and found it very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we believe we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value them so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of <unk>
The dying are warriors who protect our community and livestock and they are also angry at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is why there are so few in the National Park.
A child in my community, of six to nine years is responsible for livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought male lions were afraid of <unk>
But I realized that actually not <unk> because even I helped lions see the pen away.
I didn't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to cheat the lions so they believed that was near the <unk>
But male lions are very intelligent.   They came the first day and they saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing isn't moving, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day the lions didn't come from.
I found that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which to turn off and turn the lights.
And this is a little <unk> a <unk>
Let's get everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery -- the battery to the small box -- I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> <unk> <unk> because that's where the lions.
And that's what lions see when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> the lions so you think I'm walking around the <unk> but I'm sleeping on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never went back to have problems with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You see them. You can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've set up in seven houses in my community, and they're serving so much.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, and frightening to other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also using the farms.
And because of this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship on one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise money and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we set up lights in the houses that don't have it, and show them how they <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a child on the meadows in the savanna savanna cows of my father, and he used to see fly, and he told me that one day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be a <unk> of <unk> and a pilot when they grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving my father's cows and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting is to listen to a story like you.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: Are you working on other electric inventions in the other.
What is the next in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do one close electric power. One near you.
<unk> I know that the electric fences were invented -- but I want to do my own.
CA: So I did it once, once, right, and I tried it -- I've tried it before, but I stood up because I got a <unk>  CA: At the foot, Richard <unk> is a big thing.
We're going to <unk> in every single step that I would give my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "Don't <unk> nothing."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would come up all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except they Americas, South Korea, Japan is the enemies.
But sometimes I wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and myself never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When I <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks at all.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At little time, when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
One woman without life was on the street, holding a child in her arms looking at her arms looking at her mother's face without being able to do anything.
No one was <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine led to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during starvation and only few survived eating grass, insects and cortex cortex.
They also became more and more prevalent the energy cuts all around me was completely dark at night except for sea lights in China, just across the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite photo from North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> river that serves between North and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North America to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I see bodies floating around the river,
I can't reveal the details of how I went out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with their relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be as a refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely hard, but also dangerous, because the refugees North America in China were considered illegal immigrants in China.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested for the Chinese police, and I was arrested at the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> so I would raise my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't look natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I had to control my emotions and said, the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer said to another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North America are looking for asylum in the British <unk>
But many of them can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were <unk> they were eventually released after an international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they are <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape a lot of other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of the world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to take the way back to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South
And I started a new life again.
<unk> South Korea was a much greater challenge than I would expect.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We are all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even through a sense of identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I am? Who am I?
Anyway, there was no country that I could call my pride <unk>
Although I went to life in South Korea, it was not easy, I had a plan. I started studying for the income of income to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little bit of money that sent my family, and as Diana my family was going to be moved to the force to a place out of the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way towards freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea, and South Korea, in the South South Korea, and South Korea, in the South South South Korea, it's almost impossible to cross the edge.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Since my family could not speak Chinese, I had to take it in a way, over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught up several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and approached by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the identification of all and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, I was <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was released in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the South Korean embassy
I was going and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
And at that time, or the voice of a man wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told her the situation -- and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and to the other two North Koreans and <unk>
I had her all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do you <unk>
"I am not <unk> he said.
"I am helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown <unk> a new hope for me and for the <unk> people when I was doing it.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the international community support are really the rays of hope that the people who are <unk>
Over the time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea, and we met in South Korea, and we met in South Korea, and we met in South Korea, and we met in South Korea, and we met in South Korea, and we met in South Korea, and we met in South Korea, and we met in South Korea, and we met in South Korea, and
But its freedom is just half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, the language of English, language, practice and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North North Koreans all over the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South Center.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> food, fast terrain.
And then planners of the city came together and they thought, we're going to change the name of the South Center for which it represents something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles --  <unk> fast food, rough terrain.
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a food desert, Los Angeles Center, home of food to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to bring more people than food in the car.
People are dying of diseases in the Los Angeles Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times bigger than, say, Beverly Joubert: It's like 15 miles away.
And I would tell me about seeing this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come from home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see wheelchair wheelchair and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was to plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet three feet.
The point is, belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to run it out.
So my group and I, L.A. <unk> we put us together and we started planting our food forest -- trees -- you know, nine <unk> <unk>
What we do, we are a kind of paid set of paid hands by gardeners of all the <unk> all over the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone <unk>
The city went on top and so clearly I was given a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, <unk> became <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A court order to plant food in a piece of land that no one <unk>  And then I was like, "Well, let's go."
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
The L.A. was written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> I even called to say that we would be <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It's got <unk> miles of <unk>
That's equivalent to 20 <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million plant plants.
Why on earth does it not look good at this?
It took a plant to a <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of output.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, <unk> your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for the South Center.
I grew up there. It was my kids there.
I would love to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I farming my art.
As a <unk> artist that <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You'd be surprised to see what the Earth can do.
You simply can't imagine how astonishing it is a sunflower and how it affects the people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a education tool of education in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how it affects the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and were in my garden, went out and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who were so close to me, with hungry, and this just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people go to steal your <unk>
So what I say, "For God no, I am not afraid to go <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to get it, but I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter in the heart of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, which helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me his stories about how this had affected it, and how it used to plant their mom and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so just for a moment.
So this is how Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, like 50 people coming from, work and <unk> every single volunteer plan.
If kids are growing up, the guys will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, you will eat <unk>  But if nothing of this is <unk> if you don't teach them how the food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind things to them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work with, but they have this thing where you're sitting there in this path that are in this path designed for them, which leads them nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these guys who are engaged in their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into <unk> healthy.
I don't get stuck.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to get people to work with people, take kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
So the <unk> take your <unk> right?
That's your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I won't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me in which this is a very <unk> path.
It's made from <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, which it rains a lot.
Can you have a lot of water in the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you're going to go on your bicycle and these cars, that's not very nice.
In addition, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, close to the cities, we want a <unk>
The solution for that is to do roads in asphalt <unk> roads.
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads.
Noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very obvious, all the noise disappear, so it's a very silent <unk>
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see in this road the stones on the surface of the surface.
First, a stone, then and more and more and so on, and then -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
Oh. It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see how damage the damage in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> light, the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> they <unk> and if you're <unk> they will be <unk> and you get out of the <unk>
So if you drive down the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think about material materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is we can use <unk> <unk> of that to clean <unk> and we can cut the <unk> of steel in very small pieces, and we can mix those little pieces with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is you heat the steel, the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones are <unk> back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> oven because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here to the stage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine type in the lab to heat the <unk>
We took a lot of samples out there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So you donated a piece of road, 400 feet of the <unk> highway, where we had to make a lane of trial to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples of this road and test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of payload on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine, and the <unk> and we went back to try and try them.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've done a material using steel, steel, bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even you can double the life of the road, and they can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about if this also worked.
We still have this show here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool first before I can show you how the repairability works.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was hearing News in his little gray radius.
He had a great smile on his face that was unusual at the time, because the news is generally <unk>
<unk> got <unk> screamed at my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> in Afghanistan and they did illegal girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I would love myself as a child to give me older sister who no longer couldn't be out there, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we had a different route so that nobody could suspect where we were headed.
We had to hide the books in the market bags so it looks like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we would take our <unk> the teacher, the students and our parents.
And once in a while, the school suddenly went down for a week, because the Pakistani Pakistani <unk>
We always wondered what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan -- <unk> in that his daughter, my mother, went to school and therefore his father had him.
But my mother raised became a teacher.
This is her.
It took two years ago, just to turn our home in school for girls and women of our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate her children.
For the years of <unk> I remember that there were times when I was very frustrated about our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can tell you to leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's going on here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So you still want to do it."
I'm 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than the high school, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself so proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> of his home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He's not just <unk> of my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who drove him through the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador, of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
That's why we <unk> <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still dangerous for girls to go to school.
What's exciting is I see students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, despite and even in front of an endangered opposition.
Like <unk> It's not the real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went from the way from <unk> to his village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the road for minutes.
When you get to your house, you have a voice -- a voice gave her a voice to get her daughter to school, you would return to trying.
<unk> already, if he said, "but I don't harm my daughter for his old and <unk> <unk>
What I've realized, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of her daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they often are the first compelling <unk> of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school are told in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
I'm afraid these changes don't get a lot, after the retirement of the U.S. troops.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were doing for them, that <unk> see a future <unk> and a durable change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> I would take it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never come back to you a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the Tunisian revolution was inspired by the surge of mass <unk> so much of the massive revolution as the <unk> revolution.
A forces with many other citizens moved into and outside of the country to call one day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women are <unk> young men and young men -- they were in the middle, <unk> each of the regime, <unk> billboards of freedom, dignity and social justice.
Have you shown an courage to have the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You have shown a huge sense of solidarity from the <unk> the East, to the west to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of a brutal war and a few losses from about 50,000 dead -- we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I want to, along with many other women, rebuild the civil society, <unk> an inclusive transition and just to democracy and national kindness.
It was a number of 200 organizations in <unk> for and immediately after <unk> roughly 300 to <unk>
After a period of 33 years of <unk> I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm began to organize workshops about capacities for capacities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, leaders, very <unk> to advocate for <unk> autonomy of the woman and for our right of participation in the building of democracy and peace.
And I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was more and more <unk> of the emotional policies of domination and exclusion.
With time, our initiative was approved and successful.
The women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, shortly by little, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news about violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> <unk> old mosques and graves <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the United States of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> human rights rapes and their lack of respect for the law.
Our society, made out of a <unk> mentality, which has become better, and it's gone away from the ideals of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today at all to <unk> with our story of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the election.
Now, I'm here today to tell you that we as a nation we chose to badly, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list of <unk> and the <unk> between the candidates and <unk> brought brought peace and injury.
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish policies of domination and <unk> both for men like for women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation creation of more of what the election needed to do, which would only reduce polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the cognitive depiction of the more than it will need the representation of <unk> and quantitative <unk>
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage, and I'll call it <unk>
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, not only <unk> but also putting the <unk> rather than <unk> and collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of exclusion.
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> of war, desperately desperately desperately needs to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between women's <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the <unk> traditions have the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> that spans the whole humanity of men and women, which all tribes and all the tribes have been <unk>
And so just like the uterus covers completely the <unk> that grows in the inside, the divine matrix of compassion is <unk> all the existence.
This is how you say, "My <unk> <unk> all the things."
This is how he says, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That all of you are given to the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a funny question that has an equally <unk> response.
This is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the ones that everybody makes a miserable why she is left?
Why was anyone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. I was just at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many, many times, the man, that I create my alma mater, I would join the head with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man, as I loved no one in this world, put a gun into my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a habits of love, who fall in every year and fall of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor.
I'm a <unk> in the University of Harvard and I have an MBA in <unk> of Business <unk>
I've spent the bulk of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, and The Washington <unk>
I have almost 20 years married with my second husband and have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all of the religions, every income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> relationships and <unk> and <unk> or said in the families, the last place where we would want or we would expect to find <unk> for which, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would sit with a man who would stay with a man who misses her and actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States of the age of 16 and 24 years old, they have three times a chance of being victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and men in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and rainy night from January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York in New York and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he was also <unk> from a university of <unk> <unk> and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a guy in the field.
I had a lot of big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> <unk> and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that did happen since the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of a partner.
He did it all over the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved all of me -- that I had gone to Harvard, that I had gone to Harvard, that I was passionate about helping teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was why the degree in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and her bright future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York and let my dreams, but I thought I'd do sacrifices for your partner, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I said, I quit my work and <unk> and I went together of Manhattan.
I had no idea that she was falling into a <unk> <unk> which was head in a physical <unk> financial and psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And here is where they come into the scene of the <unk>
And as soon as we moved to New England you know, that site is supposed to be so safe I bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another that kept the pillow on our bed in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that they needed those guns to cause the trauma that was a little old.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and although I had never set up my hand, my life was really serious for every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put my girlfriend of my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were going to live happily forever because I loved it, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just a lot of <unk> for the wedding and the fact of making a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I never would hurt me.
I spent two times more on our <unk>
And the first time I was driving to a secret beach and I would tell me, and he gave me so hard in the head that I <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back of our moon of honey -- he was going down to traffic and threw me a Big Mac on my face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
It was <unk> when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One of three American women is victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control is that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why did I care?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a strong woman in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to tackle their <unk>
The other question that everybody else does is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the most sad question and agonizing that people make people, because we have the victims, we know something that normally you will <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of violence in domestic violence occur after the victim has finally turned to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent bullying even after the <unk> has returned to the financial court system and the family management system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who normally are forced by judges to spend time <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And we still keep asking why they're just not there?
I was able to <unk> because of a final <unk> because of my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if there were allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the whole world to the police, the police, my friends and family and family and family -- and I'm here today because everybody helped me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as headlines, <unk> women <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people is a way to say <unk> <unk> as if the victims <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> they learned a lesson from what happened and that they would deal with their lives and happy as <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence very typical
I went back to marry a cute little man and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to do is ever ever got to have more -- is a <unk> gun to my head of someone who says I will.
Right now, as you're thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you there's a few people that are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or that they were <unk> they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, her sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love to my particular love of silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my final request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
substance abuse, only in silence.
They have the power of ending domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need the whole world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the abuse to the light talking about it with their children, their fellow jobs, their friends and family.
They put their vision of survivors like fantastic people, who have a future <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence in order to intervene in order to slow down its climb and show the victims.
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis -- secure and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call it Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, it was 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed up the way --  luckily, I brought you clothes to <unk>
This is the first of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of luck in <unk> I think.
If some of the women will be <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to stop them now, but I will find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These dates are very <unk> less bad than I have to.
The worst part is going to go through this sweater on your head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as the head covers me.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've completely changed what they thought about six seconds.
And in this picture, there was never a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that I would take the back and put her hair on the kid.
Of course, except for surgery or an artificial <unk> as I did two days ago for work, there's very little to be able to transform our appearance, which, even though <unk> and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, be bold means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model here.
Because I'm a nice woman and white, and in my job sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people are always going to do me, but somehow they <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, a <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made me model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're asking what is this <unk>
Well, over the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed for <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my heritage legacy, that I've known to leverage for money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> <unk> There are <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> so much models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told each and every single role of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> I mean, less than four percent, they were not white.
The next question that people always make me is: Can it be a model when you grow up?"
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't take care of that.
But then, what would you really tell each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be amazing, because you are the first.
If after this spectacular list still <unk> No, no, <unk> I want to be a model, I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I am not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of <unk> <unk> or the executive director of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, it can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you run your studies, and you have a request and a little jobs on your back, you don't matter what you're going to do, I mean, if you want to be president of the United States, but you think of your sample <unk> <unk> for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, it's pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
And this was the first picture I was told by and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
So I saw my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a <unk> party, a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not in those photos.
They are <unk> <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and <unk> and all of their <unk> and people and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always doing is, let's take things for free?
I have too many heels. I have to never use, except the couple of years, but the privilege I get are the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and I forgot her for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> <unk> a red light -- and of course, we got a sorry, an agent to be able to continue <unk>
And so I'm afraid of these privileges so I think I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for their appearance, no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the <unk> teenagers who stood up and <unk> 86 percent black and Latino people, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It's about how many times I get <unk>
When I looked at this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up at 78 percent at 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little thinner and you have the most bright hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you would take it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, clever and passionate people.
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, which I never said in front of them, is: I'm a <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about it every day.
And if you ever ask, you get some thin legs and the most bright hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a bunch of models, because they have the most bright legs of the <unk> the more brilliant hair, but probably the most insecure women of the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that will retain from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in the perception of success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since it was older enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos and I didn't go who I <unk>
There was no <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a little care of lighting.
In fact, most of them are taken at random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York to give a <unk> my wife pulled me this picture by holding my daughter on the day of her first birthday. That's the corner of the 57 and five.
He just happened that we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter was approaching me, my wife told me, why don't you take me back to New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
This is when we started asking tourists that they were going to take us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has been denied with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is about a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day a six-year-old child could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a specific moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time on one week in October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only on the physical level, but in every way.
Because, although we always get the same picture, our perspective changes, and my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time in particular that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
So recently, in one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden he was stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the bottles of dolls that were small in the previous <unk>
And I described to me what was about five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we created is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of being actively becoming the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't get out of many of the family pictures.
I am always the one that takes the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all of you to come in the picture, and I didn't go back to somebody and asked him, and he gets out of a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most effective <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughs as a silly silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that I associate with Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment --  <unk> they don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   And so my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are primarily on <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of the World <unk> where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face with a high risk of extinction.
So why are they <unk> for the first place, and first of all, they provide vital ecological services.
They're our <unk> <unk>
They got the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria they help absorb the anthrax than it will be <unk> and caused huge losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent surveys have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times as much time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous historic importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between 11 and under Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and <unk> his life to save the <unk> god.
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> to open <unk> in places like <unk> there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities, they use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical model of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey from the consumption of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug.
This drug has been banned for vet in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread on the number of dogs on <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs dogs -- you have a huge bomb bomb, and the number of anger has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up to the <unk> lake.
Not against wind energy, but we need to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to birds.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and to the <unk> market.
So what is they doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel across different countries, so to focus on a useful problem that's not going to do anything.
We need to work with governments in the middle levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about understanding the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they <unk>
How can you help? Can you become active -- make noise.
When you go out of this room, you will tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed it because he saw it without effort, no energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work for my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I am not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> to <unk> that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where some Italians decided to teach people from country to grow food.
So we got with <unk> seeds in the south of Zambia to this absolutely wonderful valley that goes down to the <unk> River, and we teach the locals growing 90 Italians and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people weren't at all who were at all interested in doing that, by what they were <unk> to come to work, and sometimes they didn't survive.  We were quite amazed that the local people in so fertile valley, had never been agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that I did not hear anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here."  Let's spend time to save the <unk>
And of course, all in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these gorgeous <unk> In Italy, a tomato would grow this size. In Zambia, this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to <unk> "Look at how easy it is.
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red, from night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate it all.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought only of us all the Italians and mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, and what the English was doing and then seeing what the French were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk>    <unk> see the waste that would give them to people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western nations, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that the money has <unk>
They just read your book.
It's part of an African woman, the harm we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries and we treat people just about two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin American root that means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I try to deal with any of a different culture as if they were my children, I want a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So the white in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "My little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for the whole economic development, if people don't want to be <unk>
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the guy who opened this conference put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to do the 27 years only to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you ever motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the locals who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and she sits with the people in the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find the knowledge because no one in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community telling people what to do, why not for once, for once, but not in <unk> meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they never will tell you at a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance have been identified.
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't run their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure -- which doesn't exist.
You have to create a new career.
The profession is the family, the family family, who sets up with you in your house, on the kitchen table in your kitchen table, and that helps you find the resources to transform her passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Europe.
I was making a Ph.D. in the time, trying to move away from this junk garbage where we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects to march, and the government came to see me to say, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And I was <unk> and <unk>  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the most successful business <unk> in history, passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the business spirit.
So now <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you, <unk> you have to be fantastic to the help of the help, and then you're going to have to come up with <unk>
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people -- intelligence and <unk>
What would you talk to you else is this tomorrow?
People <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the spirit spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution, <unk> fossils -- and at one point to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it creates seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do that.
Who's going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they are doing it now.
There's a lovely story that I read in a magazine <unk> many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year, they came together with this group of people, and they <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City, wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population gets growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  And so, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City.
So what happens? For the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States of America, <unk> generic generic companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few days -- <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford funeral.
However, there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise they won't come to talk with you.
Then, you have to offer absolute <unk> <unk>
And then I have to have to tell you about the truth with <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company, it has to be able to do three <unk> things -- the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic marketing and you have to count with a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that I can do, selling and looking for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This hasn't been born.
We've looked at the 100 <unk> of the world's <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford, all the new companies, Google <unk>
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have common, only one, no one was started by one person.
Never the word self, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody starts a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment, in <unk> with bars with <unk> who will do for you, what somebody did for you, what somebody did for you, what somebody did for you, who speaks about this <unk> somebody who will ask you, what needs to do?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't swap any knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much they pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door to a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do you share more our hopes for cows to empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs to be able to reflect on our own needs.
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It's always supporting the music.  There's a film in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the most beautiful architectures in the United States.
I live near this house, and I thought how could it turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved it.
It was <unk> like a mother to <unk>
Their death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this made me a profound gratitude for the living time.
It gave the clarity of the significant stuff of my life today.
But let's go through this look at my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be catching a day and forgetting the really important thing to you.
So with the help of the old and new friends I transformed the wall of this home house on a giant slate and he painted on her phrases for <unk> Before he died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I would die I want to be tested for <unk>  Before they die I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die I want to live out of the <unk>
Before I die I want to leave you once more."
Before I die I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space has become constructive and dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they were given to me in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new new ways and <unk> It's about supporting the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and we change it.
This happened last year and started receiving hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in the civic center we did a kit and now have been made in countries across countries around the world, like South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if we give us an opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of inequality, it's more important than ever before, finding ways to preserve perspective and remembering that life is short and fragile.
The death is something we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that we have more power.
Think about the death of the death of our life.
Our spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and with more means to share fears and stories, the people around us can't only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a unique request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> has 22 years old, and it's very <unk>
No speech, but it makes joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It's shared. <unk> happen what will happen.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and notice this -- never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to say words that I couldn't even remember me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> memory <unk>
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year he came out of my children's songs that she came out of my children's songs that we kept when I was four years old, and I would take my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people disagree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although you didn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: that they were <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different form of there, which is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and although it's one of the development disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause no <unk>
I don't agree with my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
It's a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He was living and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in line around the room, looking at the washing machine, and eating anything that was in the <unk>
As I was growing up, it took more different, and the differences were made more apparent.
But beyond <unk> the frustration and the hyperactivity <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature nature that would see the world without any biases, a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, when I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change for normal.
<unk> happens for high the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different vision of what is right.
If I could <unk> one single thing to <unk> and Sam and you would have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> each one of us has a gift inside of it, and honestly, the pursuit of normality, is the last sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> the progress and the change is dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what it must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me, a teacher of communications, who gave a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  And I was really afraid.
But in the developing those conversations I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell down the <unk> <unk> and saw the door of a new world.
Just so I sat down when I had those conversations with the students, so the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges from energy and health care between others, and if we don't know about it, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as a scientist to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and their engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that we study <unk> but they study the <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and try and treat it.
And when you're describing your science, careful <unk>
The slang is a obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making dumb silly things.
Instead, as Einstein said Einstein, that everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without engaging ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies and are ways that they put together with their content.
And by presenting her work, forget the <unk>
Have you wondered why they call <unk>  What do we do the <unk> and the <unk> kill and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's supporting too much in the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that he actually inspired the unique design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a very simple line, <unk> that public can understand whether it loses a little bit, and then provide graphs that we would bring to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what it is <unk>
I think these are just some key keys that can help others open the door and look at the country of wonders which is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they've solved this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words about all the <unk> English <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor of the 19th century that defined her much better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who seeks a public care -- no matter wanted the platform or the beginning, and that when he wins, you get it by the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what <unk> means.
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament enabled newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> chamber.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the former name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
He was thrown in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to tackle them, and at the end, he had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first registered use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of them think it's <unk>
It's not. It's by a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
You didn't know.
How you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced to all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some people wanted to call <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the North America <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was tried to be quality.
And not even with that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen by the King of a given <unk>
And there might be <unk>
Everybody got tired of <unk> because this debate was happening for three weeks.
I read the newspaper for a poor <unk> and always <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want to get Washington out of power.
They didn't want to call King for if they didn't give him or his <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> more insignificant and more unfortunate than it happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. invented the title. There was no longer before, but it just meant <unk> that I had a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a trivial title.
And that's why the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would take a serious title with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't go down.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> it was the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to follow there, waiting for the Senate to action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we are going to keep up waiting for the years.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important thing, and this is the title of President of the United States it doesn't sound at all that modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads and <unk> the largest economy in the world and a fleet of aerial aerial vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story have endowed with the title of <unk>
So I actually won the <unk>
<unk> his title of <unk>
And also the other concern that the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So in the end, the Senate won and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell you that now it's the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
Now, politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and use the reality, but really, actually change a lot more the words that they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet under land in an illegal mine.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies <unk> in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak to you, but mostly that cacophony of male <unk> and stones and <unk> <unk> tools.
Like the other hand, I carry a cheap flashlight of light on his head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> the branches that they hold the walls of that hole in a meter that would fall down hundreds of feet on the ground.
I took my hand and all of a sudden I remember a <unk> I met earlier before, who lost control and dropped miles into that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep part of that hole in risking their lives without paying reward, and often, dying.
I went home from that hole and I went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents and in 2009, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the World Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met an <unk> of <unk> the <unk> an NGO which has been to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew there was a world in the world, but not such a degree.
When we end up talking to me, I felt very sad, I was honestly trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me a <unk> and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and I offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are now more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of African Africans during the whole of the U.S. slave
150 years ago, the cost of a slave slave was about three times the annual wage of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 people today.
However, today, we can <unk> entire families for generations for <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates over <unk> dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work for then to find out that they're forced to work without pay, under violence in threat and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable animals.
<unk> exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange show and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
It was in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, children, children, kids, in fact, entire families of <unk> stack in <unk> <unk> bricks in their heads up to 18 at the time, and they take the <unk> <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no breaks to eat, or to drink, the severe <unk> did that pee was pretty <unk>
As <unk> they were the heat and the dust that my camera got too hot to it, and I stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the car and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was next to my side very quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't you do it. Don't do here."
And he explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were gone.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for her release and he trusted to do it.
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children carrying stones for miles on <unk> <unk> until trucks that were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who would charge and the kids would take them to their heads with straps -- made them made of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something as <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours per day without <unk> because this has been so much of his life.
You don't have anything to <unk>
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> <unk> completely their houses.
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness I thought it would be difficult for me to work on this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk> sex.
I was driven by a <unk> <unk> that gave this basement <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as being known in craft, are local prostitution for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms, private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of that only seven years -- they are forced to entertain customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each post is dark and dirty identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
From standing in the <unk> I remember making sense of a wild <unk> and in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that <unk>
I just had a <unk> the stairs for where you <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no big windows like <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and because we played a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people sitting in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 dollars and 300,000 American children were sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles is another activity that often relate to labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages in which there were entire families involved in the trade of silk.
This is a family of family.
Your black hands are the father, the blue and blue <unk> of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is toxic.
My performer told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope that we can come out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay us our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the <unk> Lake <unk> the world's largest <unk>
When we got there, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a family family on a boat, two older brothers -- some more young children makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their <unk> families who have been forced to work extensively in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up with me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
<unk> branches of trees plunged into Lake <unk> often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear, is thrown water to release the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love, it's not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to the younger slaves under their seat.
I met these guys in five o'clock in the morning, when they were going to look at the last networks, but they had been working on the time.
On the cold and <unk> night.
And it struck that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued by a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes is possible.
Who will come to be because of someone decided to make a difference in their life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bike.
He asked us to do it for a dirt path to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we moved out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out very quickly.
And then he signal this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started to go down, we took the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking close to an hour we found that the path was <unk> so I put the pictures of pictures on my head as I walked into these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up <unk> in the end, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football camp, and they were all filled with workers enslaved.
A lot of women had kids strapped to their backs, and while they were looking for gold, they were <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember he looked at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have to be 90 feet and these people are carrying heavy heavy bags bags that then will be pushed to another area where they were able to extract the gold.
At the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer at the side, the margin is to work at other lucky ones, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of T.B. and <unk> for a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he took him to work with him in mines.
When he died their uncle, <unk> I did inherit the uncle of the uncle who force it in the mines.
When I met her, I'd worked in 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in <unk> so serious that the doctors were saying it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and, nevertheless, that, is forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams about being released and <unk> with help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, of purpose to a remote possibility that inspires me a lot respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give testimony to them, and we're going to do everything about it to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see ourselves with each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not magazines. They're from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect for their lives.
There's no day that I don't think about these so many beautiful people that I have had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images take a force in which you see people like you, and I hope that force will turn on a fire and that <unk> light on slavery is about slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematical math. And there's a peculiar problem for whom we <unk> we are like management business.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers.
But classic demands an extraordinary degree of opportunity, a high level of skill, and probably some initial <unk> that can be a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease gradually gradually this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time was a virtuous dancer dance.
In the last few years, it's been made a lot of progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with <unk> <unk> <unk> stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need to use it to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective way and ultimately, the only way we will know if there really exists a cure will be when we have an objective and <unk>
But it is frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological <unk> that's why it doesn't serve blood analysis, and the best thing we have is a neurological exam for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic. It's very, very expensive, and that means that out of the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the exam <unk>
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to do with you about as a conventional <unk> for a try, you see, in some sense at least we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of <unk> ropes.
It shows someone healthy as it emits sounds at talk, and we can imagine as a dancers of a <unk> <unk> because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes needed -- for example.
And as the <unk> requires an extraordinary <unk>
Let's think about time that takes a child to learn to speak.
So from sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as you <unk> and as a Parkinson's disease affects the <unk> it affects the organs.
In the bottom box you can see an example of <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
Set a loving shake and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both <unk>
<unk> test is not <unk> both of the existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole range of hospitals to do them.
They're both <unk> OK, but in addition to <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take 30 seconds like a lot.
They're minimum cost and we all know what happens.
When something takes up a cost so <unk> it appears on a massive scale.
These are some incredible lists for <unk>
We can reduce the demands of the patients, of patients.
I wouldn't do need to go to the clinic and take routine.
<unk> monitoring could often get objective data.
We could make mass <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's disease.
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start dealing with these goals.
We have <unk> affordable lines for 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with <unk> or without Parkinson's disease, it can call it low and leaving recordings that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.  
What are you going to take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the so-called <unk> you have to indicate if you have or not the disease.
<unk> You see, some people may not exist. You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion factors in search of the real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have an precision <unk> at this point?
<unk> A lot more than that.
In fact, my student <unk> I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well, what we would put on the project. We now have an precision.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> gray.
We lie in the dark, in rooms without windows and large, we avoid the solar light.
We make thin models still more <unk> the perfect skin, the perfect <unk> we do the impossible -- we can do the impossible and focus on the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
A long time later, an organization where it was <unk> There was <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little old fishing town in <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The level of water is achieved over 24 feet tall and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
We got rubble from the waterways and <unk>
<unk> schools, we took the mud and we leave the lists to be <unk> and <unk>
We removed and tons of dead fish and tons of dead fish -- <unk> from the local factory.
We love and loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> photos and cameras and punch cards.
Everybody did the same.
<unk> and bring them to different places of the towns around the <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that these pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a center of <unk>
It helped clean the toilets, the enormous, gigantic gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the <unk> center came up with the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor of that day <unk> to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression to think beyond the <unk> but it wasn't going to go through myself my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some of them in the lab, I found some of them in the lab in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and in the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive, I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to get up with a lot accuracy and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
With the passage of the time, they got more kind of more pictures and they needed more <unk> so I entered again on Facebook and <unk> and five days later -- 80 days later -- <unk> people were offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we would give us a <unk> a neighbor of neighbor to North <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the temporal operating libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their pictures.
The time we <unk> in <unk> is a different story -- depended on of course <unk> of the photos.
It could do an hour. I could make a weeks.
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw almost hand by hand using the <unk> areas whose color and detail had no <unk>
I took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures <unk> in saltwater, and covered in bacteria, with algae, even with the course of the time of time -- I continue to <unk> for that <unk> -- was a major part of the project.
We couldn't <unk> the photo unless it was clean up, and he would have been <unk> by her <unk>
We had a <unk> <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm the photos even more <unk>
As one once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky in relation to the photos.
I had begun to <unk> her same but stopped realizing that I would get them even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not have been <unk> we were able to take the images in a single picture, and we had the full picture.
When I collected their pictures shared something about his story with us.
A few colleagues in her husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble rather than where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would take it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while <unk> <unk>
Their children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took a week to find her whole family and know that they all had survived.
The day I gave him his photographs his youngest <unk>
For her, despite all of this, these pictures were the best gift that he could see -- something that he could remember from the past that he would not have been marked by that day of March when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan -- 1,100 volunteers had joined up there -- hundreds of them helped us clean up over <unk> photographs, the big <unk> -- the vast majority of them went back to their <unk> <unk>
Over 500 volunteers all over the world helped us to bring up 90 families and completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them in ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, someone wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would have to take us to look for.
This was the project, to restore little bits of humanity, to bring someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this gets back to somebody, there's a huge difference in the life of the person that you get in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger -- using their talent to something that won't be thin of perfect skin.
To finish I would like to read this email -- I sent Cindy on the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I could, I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular one, a photo with women from different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, <unk> around a baby, <unk> me because a little bit of my family my grandmother, my grandmother and my daughter just <unk> <unk> from our wall.
In the whole world, all of our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet going through an apple in a <unk> of just a millionth of a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not about a million or a billion <unk> but a billion <unk> per second.
I present to a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique so fast that you can create video camera of light moving.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and they challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and switch on it and I switch it into a <unk> second, you know, in a number of <unk> we create a photo package of just a millimeter of width of wide width of width of wide width of width of width of width of width of wide width and width of it.
And that package of photons, that <unk> will travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common <unk>
If you take that bullet and this <unk> package on this bottle, how you disperse these photons into this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --  -- remember all of this happens in less than a <unk> it's what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light moving.
So Coca-Cola doesn't take this research --     -- so many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a photo package that starts <unk> and that inside, starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> goes to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally get to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a <unk> bubble that bounces inside the inside.
In that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the reflections of the top of the top you see in the background of the bottle, after several boxes, that reflections were <unk>
Now, if you take a normal bullet and current and we do that you take the same distance and you see it in slow motion at about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
A day? A week? Actually, every year.
It would be a very boring movie -- a slow <unk> in motion.
And what about testing nature <unk>
You can see the waves that are coming from the table of the tomato and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, and I was thinking, well, of course, our eyes see a full composition of view.
But if you look at more and more you look at this <unk> as the light stands off the tomato <unk> it goes down. They don't <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces on its inside and it comes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture of the <unk> it comes very little <unk>
But we're going to take a billion times faster than the shortest exposure to a little bit of light.
We <unk> that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very mild <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data into raw and <unk> <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see after <unk>
The idea is that we could shine a little bit of light on the door.
And we could extract those multiple light bulbs of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, at slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique abilities.
It has very good time resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door to the door and also the hidden objects, but we don't know what about the point that corresponds to what a distance.
When you project a laser you can record a picture, you can record a picture in the screen, which you see on the screen, it doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like that, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we take this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are collisions with what is next to the <unk>
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light by open windows.
Or we could build <unk> to be able to see the inside of the body -- <unk> and the same for <unk>
But, of course, because of the fabric and the blood this is pretty hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new visualization of the visualization to solve the problems of the Internet imaging in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, I became the science of art, an art of photographs <unk>
And I realized that all of the data data that we harvest is not just for scientific visualizations but we can see it.
We create a new form of computational photography, with slow motion and silk <unk>
And let's look at those <unk> Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here's a funny thing as well.
If you look at the waves underneath the <unk> you drop from us.
The waves should be moving towards us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which events occur in the world sometimes appears to be invested in the camera.
We put the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and gives you military freedom.
With a mobile phone, you can get a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a smartphone you can tweet a message and initiate a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and you can get it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were going to look for a change.
So this is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people who were going to go out to be looking for a change, had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who are you having a phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, <unk>
It's a lot. Almost everybody today has a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how I changed life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
Serious data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission I introduced a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every single telephone company, every single day of Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls someone who calls an email to whom.
Who sends a text to whom.
And if we use our mobile phone, where we are.
All this information is stored for at least six months, and until two years, in his phone company, or his Internet provider of the Internet.
And across Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10 thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of Eastern Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, and please let me get all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to me, and I didn't get a particular answer. It was all blah, <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
And so I decided to give you a lawsuit for me and I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end, I agreed.
They got the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court Court -- <unk> failed for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
At first, I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge archive.
But after a while I realized it is my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what <unk> means.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> we did this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom in, and you step back and go forward.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see how I go on the train to <unk> and how often I call it the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just me.
It's about all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, and we talked about a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call them each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we ended up with this big communications network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other, what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who email you, who email you from who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this has never happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, maybe never happened.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible inside and outside the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you come home to tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not <unk>
When you go home, tell her to your representative because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store for you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to give them to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call it <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, for that -- all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm a blend of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother, and not the <unk> because my parents were cousins, brothers, although they are.
It just happens for accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not an inspirational source of inspiration -- I don't want any of you in the present people.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you've used to be disabled at any time.
Let's go for a ride.
Christmas Christmas, are at the shopping mall, drive in circles looking for parking spaces, and what do you see?
It was 16 empty places for disabled places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit of <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a gold <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a dancer, Muslim women, a woman, who live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you may be doing it.
I'm in <unk> in New Jersey.
I always love that my neighborhood and my disease had the same early ones.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I do.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the "Don't live.
And the mantra of my father was, "Can you get it, do it work for <unk>
If my three biggest sisters -- I was <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents would go to the school system, and I would find out that I was out there, and if you didn't get all the ultimate note -- all of you -- the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk in the five years putting my fingers on his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me for him to get it.
The <unk> I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking as a bomb champion that has received a lot of <unk>
By growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> like campaign.
The people that I grew up had had no problems with my faith.
But nevertheless, it seemed like <unk> a lot that died of starvation during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating eat, so you stop from dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't pay physical therapy, so I sent me to the dance school.
I learned dancing with <unk> or I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends wear <unk> I too.
And when my friendships were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get into <unk>
On my summer holiday I was often about <unk> so I was drinking <unk> milk so on my back, I was drinking <unk> warm on the back, and I remember the water <unk> and I remember the water, and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the miraculous cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before I do yoga it was a comedian of <unk> I couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can hold it on the head.
My parents would take this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital in <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive <unk> and I got a grant for the University of Arizona, the State of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater.
All of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the less intelligent, I took the ultimate note in my lectures, and also in his classes.
Every time I did a scene of the glass zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with a <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started shouting at the four <unk> When I finally have a <unk>
I've got <unk> <unk>
In order to <unk> In order to <unk>
Thank God <unk> I'm finally <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running at the director of the theater, by crying in historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, asking for why and she told me that because they believed that I could not do the risk scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the <unk> you can't do the <unk> either.
It was a role for the fact that they literally were born and they gave it to an actor.
I was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors with disabled actors for disabled people.
I came back home, and my first tour, <unk> was sort of an extra thing in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> and I didn't see me more than <unk> and it was obvious to me that directors not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with disabilities.
Just listen to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I did <unk>
In my first tour, I can turn by famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he fell into the realization that I was going to high speed on the highway in New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral palsy,
I worked in <unk> in the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say that I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you've never heard that little rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the Festival of <unk> <unk> from New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in media and to remind the directors of <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma <unk>
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the cable news program it has Keith <unk>
I walked into a graduation dance, I joined a studio and sat at a studio and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I cling to the desk of the United States to not get out of the screen during the <unk> and when the interview ended the interview, was <unk>
Eventually, I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they would not come back.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but he was kind of like <unk> and bashed my chair.
Something fun I learned with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
The kids are said that kids are <unk> but they never fall away from me and even older than me.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
I would watch clips online with comments like, "Why <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite favorite, <unk>
What does it have?
We should really be praying for her."
A <unk> suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> can't make someone on <unk>
The disability are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man. Come on.
The disability is the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying that not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, I had grown up with media, I don't think we would think.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday lives.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would make it less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My journey <unk> has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I came to act in a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I started <unk> <unk> a charity to give children refugees by Palestinians with the tiniest tiny part of what my parents would tell me.
It was the only time my father saw me live live, and I'm doing this talk to his memory.
It's <unk> in peace, <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a little town in the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> to poverty and poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, no job, no perspectives of future.
He's just living in a tent in the city to the outskirts of <unk>
A year <unk> nothing.
One day she gets about a guy who offers to take him to <unk> after dinner to dinner,
It empowers a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money so that they bought new clothes to send home to your family.
He presented a young one.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a car bomb.
That kid in that little village with the dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist terrorist and that dynamic group of people were in the <unk> a terrorist organization with Al Qaeda.
So how do a kid in a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for it.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that came up.
This was the first thing that pulled it out of what we call <unk> <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban <unk> who were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London who were looking for something beyond <unk> <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of the opportunity, in well-being, but the young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth that suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities are going to be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them the opportunities, the story of <unk> <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to the violence, to <unk> to be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my city of birth, you know, 70 percent of the young men is <unk>
70 percent not work is not going to school.
They do practically nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital that was born.
I remember standing in the hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support young leaders at a business force.
They went to some 90 young leaders in <unk>
We sat down and we had one of the ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because it was a college college college university university university for Al <unk> and other terrorist organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the point B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
They started <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and her dream is at some point to expand to hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this different story?
What does this story different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
They encourage young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of the corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of the business initiative to create a culture of social initiative as well.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until I, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from <unk>
If you give somebody, "When it was the last time you saw <unk>
For those of those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is, <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm outside of <unk> and started growing <unk> and <unk> that he said, you could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And he began the delivery of flowers for wedding on, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies and now is working in the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There is no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where families, young people can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, their innovation, it really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
<unk> to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspiring young people and creating a culture of corporate spirit is really a big step, but the young people need capital to make their ideas.
They need expertise and guidance to <unk> the development and set of their business.
It empowers young people to the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and you will create the problem for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her <unk> <unk> is how it's called, when it's created, to transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the motorcycles for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their innovation, and they have more stories about flowers and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains -- an area <unk> in North York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was doing that the leaves leaves like a <unk> and not the way that we were born, almost to pretend that we were the first human beings on step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> on a beautiful <unk> lake.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they thought they were going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where to <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash away.
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash over <unk> tons of waste and <unk> tons of recyclable products.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who I do that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go into more.
So I began to work like trash cans.
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And <unk> the mechanical <unk> and the snow <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as diverse as you believe it, and in the days it's very strong one will be <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to the weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every day.
And it's also danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> the waste collection is one of the ten most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and moving in the traffic all day and pass on all around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for <unk>
And also the crap itself is full of dangers that are often falling from the truck and cause terrible <unk>
I also learned about the trash of waste.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you can understand that garbage is as a force of nature itself.
Never stop coming.
It's also like a form of breath or circulation.
You always have to be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that the stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important labor of the city streets for three reasons.
They are the first protective protection <unk>
If you don't get rid of the waste <unk> and effectively every day, this starts to break away from their containers and its dangers inherent to us in very real ways.
We have controlled it for decades and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old we have no room for what the motors in the economy begin to fail when it's endangered as well.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just pointed out its relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed necessary.
With that, I mean just the speed that you used to move in the contemporary age.
We usually don't care about it, and we have to do with us our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water <unk>
We use them, the <unk> we forgot about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side and so on.
So I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us safely from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow always has to stay in one way or another.
On one day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a garbage collection truck on the street, grabbed my little son and I went down the stairs running, and there was a man doing his journey of <unk> as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be right."
Shortly after that I started looking at waste harvesting and went back to this man.
It's called <unk> we worked together a lot of times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that I was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and have to account for all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor.
The city waste -- what we think when we talk about crap. represent three percent of the whole waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistics.
So in the flow of your day and their lives, the next one to see someone whose job is to clean up the crap of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life -- forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
I brought in two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a business center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, and my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people cannot afford to buy things.
Second, you need to spend a lot of energy because the crystals with crystals generates heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, it looks like it has nothing to do with Africa and in Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the old market structure, which is this structure in the air and thousands of people, and they are buying things every day to little <unk>
That's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a modern building of various stories by applying these principles.
The next challenge is introduced to survey the site, which is located in a lot of the growth of the city, where much of the buildings we see now in the image, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was we create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs of the building.
And this extends out with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space in the open air in the building that are <unk> by its own shape, of the sun and the rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would go to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a concrete shell.
And then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses on the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me do the <unk>
We are building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that use light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it didn't be easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It was not what we <unk>
But finally, we all realized that this market idea was much more profitable than the commercial center because in the end of course, there were more local to sell.
And in addition to the idea of the facade was a tremendous amount of economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air <unk>
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the power of energy to the building in a city where electricity was short almost every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, and in conjunction they collect water for <unk>
It's expected for the early year, because we go through the fifth floor of the building as well.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I made special attention in the <unk> a thousand years old that was surrounded by a wall with twelve gates of access to almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the streets existing and create 12 very similar blocks between size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic spots in relation to the idea of the interconnected doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell of the project, like apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best guidance for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation, for it.
So <unk> a scheme that claims most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to <unk>
And also responds to local standards that set a greater density in the upper levels and lower density in the plant low.
And so it reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost how to give the community the space occupied by construction.
It's where all of the neighbors, can you go up and get them out and make activities such as running a two miles in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people changes the communities and local economies at the same rate that the buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
It had huge amounts of very bright hair, and a little <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year, and I was full of <unk> until I got my sinister plan.
I had a time after the exit of the school -- I was a little bit late and I hid in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the table of my master's comic book.
And then I did.
And I put the ratings out of my <unk> just a little bit, just some like this.
All the same way.  And I set up the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
And so in a <unk> we will hold the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put up all rows of <unk> and myself in a row of that, just by being there, because I was there.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I'm never going to tell me.
It's that everything was <unk>
I never got <unk>
But most of all, I was fascinated by the reason that I told me that this <unk> so small, so good for <unk>
Would jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
Also limited birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause for spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that we would have to do that loneliness, or the long length or sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab that you study <unk> in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it is an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> <unk> there would have no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There was no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
I wouldn't have Shakespeare.
We would take the lists of reading school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there's no <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the <unk> it has all of them.
This year here is 100 years of his masterpiece, "In the search for <unk> <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the <unk> of the common <unk> my God, all we could have.  And think about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot about what it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk>
I don't know what the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as <unk> that is reduced to the person, to their wish, and they are a very good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel bad.
Being a storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details I want, to put the knife around, right?
<unk> make us all novelists <unk> and that's something that I understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give you pleasure to another, maybe right now.
And it starts to call himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every great charm that <unk> detects on his lover -- adds to his collection of instruments of <unk> in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break off it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's tough work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an amazing emotion. You need to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> comes from information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like big amounts of hair, and the cute little bit of <unk>
<unk> came from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> links the language of jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony listening to the door and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then <unk> those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an ancient text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> you see <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, which is the search for the truth, a very painful truth -- in fact, to what <unk> <unk> the most painful truth the truth.
The pain, the <unk> <unk> these were the <unk> <unk>
He says, "A woman who need, who makes us suffer, that makes us suffer, a lot more profound and vital feelings that a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> will reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us behave in this particular way.
There's some other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at so <unk>
Freud would write about this later on.
One day, Freud went to a very <unk> young man who was being used with the idea that his wife would <unk>
And Freud said that there was something strange about that man, that he didn't get <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or sounded like a man?
Freud said the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> described very well how the <unk> make us look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, we are, the more we become the residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent or illegal acts.
<unk> drives us to behave in completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan for 52 year-old years was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from the fact that they were sending <unk> messages to himself, for a year.
For a year, every year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of her <unk> <unk> I have to tell you that when or this, I reacted with awe.
Because let's be realistic.
How big -- even though we get creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> novel, <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character from the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books try to how <unk> <unk> our minds and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what is what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to take out of your self and get it out of what you ever had, and it's under the floor, your name, it takes your <unk> cow accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live at jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not safe when they are at a mystery.
Let's go to Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think of <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I have always had <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of rat <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> <unk> but she bothers it.
Oh, I sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it would be <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally at "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you walk in, you walk into the <unk> to all with her solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there's no one person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to shake your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> was in history. It seems to me this very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat them as a problem of geometry, without excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next side is the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being <unk>
Could it be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to worry about the excellence of the other.
We can relate it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So while we hope that that happens, we have a fiction for <unk>
Only fictional fiction, jealousy.
fiction used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet thing, the scary <unk> the crazy <unk> the crazy <unk> the black Proust <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> module.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but his presence on the <unk> gray was the culmination of a collective process of <unk>
The Apollo program was the biggest mobilization.
To get to the moon, I spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 companies and universities and universities government agencies.
They died people, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
He walked on his surface, of which went after Mr. Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that the <unk> <unk> then a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynics answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy in Rice University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some people ask, why do we <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And you might ask, why scale the mountain most <unk>
35 years ago, why fly over the <unk>
Why does he play Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the east of the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> of the powers of technology.
It was because it was a great power to do that.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of long list.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the <unk> <unk> and eliminated smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a <unk> ship, but in 1969, the Apollo crew came to 40,000 miles / hour.
From 1970, no human being went back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of <unk> 10, and the optimism joyful about the power of technology has evaporated to see that the problems that we imagine would solve as going to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seems to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't give up the <unk> tube -- the rocket Saturn rocket.
I knew so much that this would be the last mission to do, but I was completely sure I would have to see colonies on Mars.
So that's what happened to our capacity to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have found themselves <unk> and become enriched with trivial, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that we need to be created by less ambitious companies that are <unk> from the years to <unk> Intel and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> specifically, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of <unk> ideas by funding problems -- or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It's mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without concern at risk, they preferred small investment investment, which they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing in technologies like energy, which need a huge amount of capital and development in the long term.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose we don't solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if you go to Mars if you go to Mars.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that's never going to happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things than doing on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption from renewables of renewables like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are aware of what policies and treaties to <unk> the development of <unk> energy, which is a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control control of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an energy energy policy or corporate treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, they have not to be.
We know from time that famines are result of failure in the <unk>
But 30 years of research have been taught that famines are the political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage and <unk> <unk> but there will be famines of while there were bad governments.
And finally, the big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't really understand the problem.
The President Nixon reveals the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we found out that there are many kinds of cancer, some severely resistant to the treatment, and only over the last 10 years seems to have found effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and <unk> but these four elements have to be <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> must be really about a problem -- and we need to understand it.
<unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability to solve the technology to solve big problems, it serves with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like John Kennedy in the Cold War, there's no political like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, it wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We are alone in our present, and the solutions of the future are going to be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to begin to fill you the ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that they have become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a very large decline of trust, it's a very widespread <unk>
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think <unk> the goal and task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you about today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about it.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own, I don't know the answer.
It turns me to think that it may have gone down in some activities or institutions that could have risen on others.
I have no course.
But I can turn to the surveys of view, and the surveys of opinion are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the surveys of opinion over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> about 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, keep inspiring the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still a lot of <unk> judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway around.
But it's evidence for enough?
What <unk> polls are, of course, views.
What else can you get?
What you're looking at is <unk> attitudes that people experience when they ask certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk>
<unk> at the teachers of <unk>
You probably have to ask the question: "What for?"
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you could say, when you have answered your question, "Well, I trust you in some of the other no."
What is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit confidence.
We don't assume the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> an official or a guy -- it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, saying I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give the lecture class, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but no, perhaps, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they are trying to pursue the good judgment of the fact that they trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the <unk>
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's an objective goal.
This is not the goal that I <unk>
I want to be more confidence in what it's <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> not trusting what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who would raise their savings with the very <unk> named Mr. Madoff, who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say, yeah, yeah, that means that what it matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
Which is about making a judgment of how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can make a trial, we are forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the raw goods and is responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be <unk>
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but they didn't fit in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that they would be <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I don't have a lot of friends who are competent and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I haven't yet been <unk>
But that's what we're <unk> to do before trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we have tried to build systems systems for all sorts of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, that they make them easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as a <unk>
I remember once he was talking to a <unk> and he said to me, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to make <unk> <unk> which will be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public living life, and we would argue that the system of accountability that is destined to ensure that <unk> and testing tests are actually doing the opposite.
What they do is we <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You probably know all of you are similar examples.
All of that, for the target.
And I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we need to be worthy of confidence and encourage people that we're safe and if you try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple action, the <unk> what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
They <unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, they try to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately, is signature because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give you the foundations enough so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> by all people -- all the time.
But you also have to try to test it that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That's a daily basis. everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks socks to say I can leave them without giving them <unk>
I take them and return your money, or do you change the color of the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing out is not a very difficult thing to do.
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worth confidence.
Thank you.
From the early computers we have <unk> us to reduce the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone to become increasingly and more and more, to a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a glass screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I wouldn't have <unk>
So I started imagining how we <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that gets into the digital space, so that when you get it strong against the screen it transfers its physical body to <unk>
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool you break the barriers.
But the two hands still stay out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of your hands?
In the <unk> of Science <unk> from Microsoft, along with my mentor mentor people, <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
They put a transparent bombsight with depth cameras to detect the fingers and the face, now you can lift the hands of the keyboard, get into the inside of space, and then grab pixels directly with hands.
Like windows and files have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and point out lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is down every floating screen.
<unk> can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we type in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital data come up to us?
<unk> many of us would have bought and put things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision you get from a device mounted on your head or <unk> when the system understands geometry in your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make it physicists so we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> I created this one physical <unk>
This imam <unk> acts like a pixel in 3D space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere in this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And to program the object, the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and distance and the famous distance -- and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the planets, the physics, and, unlike the monitors or the textbooks or the text, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's really fascinating that changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities together.
As you can see, digital data is not just going to show something but begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without we have to deal with our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if we suppressed that barrier, the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was struck by becoming a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to <unk> a school for athletes with all expenses payments.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to become an engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution -- they believed strongly that there was only an effective path towards <unk> a safe job and good work.
No matter if I work or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer Chinese.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the Institute of a radio show.
But no adults would tell the idea.
No adults took me seriously.
Only my friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more <unk>
My dream never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life -- a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
Nobody ever wanted me to do it. Okay.
I took the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about life <unk>
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said to myself, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
And I find this with a new culture also led to my reading habit sometimes.
<unk> lots of perspectives.
For example, in the beginning this map was that I thought this was because this is what students in China learn.
I'd never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading isn't something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There is to fields of research like comparative religion and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> offers an understanding deeper to a subject.
And I thought if reading reading was working to research, why don't you do that in life <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
You can be from <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For Christ, <unk> are economic and political <unk>
For Buddha, it's all <unk> lust, fear and duty.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> rather than lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, this is through the translation that I realized in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I will not go back to feeling or powerless never.
To make a dream <unk> it's not really compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams come from, where the passion comes from, where happiness.
A <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in a clinic at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named Alex.
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a week <unk> dropped on the couch in my office and took my shoes off, and he told me that I wanted to talk about the problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a first client.
And I had a <unk> who wanted to talk about men.
I thought he could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the sessions, it made me easy to just move the head while we would get the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> and he said, Alex, and what I saw was right.
You start to work after, you start to work after, you have children later, to death later.
For you as Alex and I had time to get there.
But shortly afterwards, my squad <unk> pushed me to press Alex that I would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Sure, he's coming out with guys underneath his category <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like he was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it was <unk> with the next one.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before it <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they do, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a break.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect time and we were <unk>
So I realized, this kind of <unk> benign was a real problem and had real consequences, not just for Alex and his loving life but for careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you believe that no one comes to adulthood without going to happen before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see <unk> here.
Oh, yeah. They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take your dream out -- you take your dream -- I want to see. All right. <unk> the <unk> matter.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be about 35 years old.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give you life will have happened to when you have 30 and <unk>
People in the '40s, not trying to panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on how many money they <unk>
We know that more than half the Americans are married, they live in their own couple of their own 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and it was <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change yourself, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any time in the life of life, and we know that the female fertility gets to its top to the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the time to <unk> about their body and their choices.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what <unk> are listening.
<unk> talk about changes in the line of time of <unk>
Researchers call the <unk> a extended adolescence.
<unk> were <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to get big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it?
What do you think happens when you get a <unk> in your head and they say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and ambition and his ambition is absolutely nothing.
And then every day, smart, smart, interesting as you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while starting a race before the 30, all will be right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better design day the day I graduated from birth.
And then starting to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, it crashed music and all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would sit stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when he was <unk>
Where are the monkeys here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds kind of extreme -- but it doesn't surprise you, the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there is a huge pressure to the '30s and so many of them starting a career, to choose a partner, choose a partner, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
And so many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that begin to show, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying green sports cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want right now.
You realize you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you look at themselves, and to me, you see themselves in the room, and you talk about his <unk> "What was you doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At the 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said she would like to work in art or entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last years working like <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And even though he was living in a very difficult <unk> their previous life had been even more difficult.
And so often in our sessions, but then she was getting up to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, Emma came his head on his legs and he cried for almost the entire hour.
I had just bought a new set of <unk> and I had spent all the morning <unk> with her many minutes, but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> please call <unk>
He was about to <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who will be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I get <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and not say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> who really was <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his chance.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the <unk> <unk>
So for the next weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that crisis of identity and <unk> identity capital.
For identity capital, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: capital capital generates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, that <unk> of that company you want to try to try to try it to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try it to it.
I'm not <unk> exploration, I am <unk> exploration that shouldn't tell you, by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma the jobs I would work and work on and to do it.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great for you to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with similar minds to be similar to who you know what you know, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who comes out almost always comes out of the outside of the circle of the day.
The new things come from what they call the weak ties friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> you have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half won't, and the weak ties are the shape of the <unk> to this group.
Half of the jobs created never <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is the way we get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family when he has a couple of a couple of her own family.
I told Emma that the time for her family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person that you live in now or <unk> now when everybody on Facebook begin to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it or killing time with anyone who <unk> you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a quarter of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That work supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, that she alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
My new career, she loves his new family, and I would send me a letter that said, "Now the emergency room spaces are not enough.
<unk> story can sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like airplanes coming from Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before you look at it, a light fits in your trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at the same way, at the age of 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects for the next few years or even in the next generations.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk> you know.
It's as simple as I learned to tell Alex.
It's what I have the privilege of telling you to <unk> all the <unk> The <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> your <unk> get the capital of identity, and you use your lungs, you pick your weak connections, choose your family.
Don't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job at <unk> for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I was to teach them mathematics to graduate students in New York City.
And as any professor, <unk> tests and tests.
I give them tasks.
When the job comes back, I will bring the grades.
What struck me is that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance did not have <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in seventh in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts aren't impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during the time.
After several years, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure it as well.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults all kinds of scenarios and in each study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the West Academy <unk>
We try to predict what they were trying to do in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what kids would make as far as possible in competition.
We studied teachers, <unk> working in really difficult neighborhoods, and what teachers are still teaching themselves for the end of the school and <unk> who will be the most effective thing to improve the results of their <unk>
We associate with private enterprises, asking yourself, which of these vendors are going to keep their <unk>
and who's going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it emerged a trait as a major <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future day after day, not only the week, not only for the week, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a high-speed career.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my questionnaires of determination and then waited about over a year to see who they <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had a significantly higher likely chance of graduation, even when they were <unk> in every single trait that I could measure, things like family income, the results of <unk> tests, even the safety of the children when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or at the National <unk> of <unk> where it matters <unk> it's also in school, especially for children at risk.
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, how little science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we develop determination for children?
What should I do to teach kids a strong ethic of work?
How do I keep them very motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give it <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are talented individuals that just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, determination often is not related or related to closely correlated for talent.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that at Stanford University of Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to be <unk> when you do because they don't believe that that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and need <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to start to fail, to start with the lessons back with the lessons together.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
And since that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great <unk>
In the last few years, I've been asking myself if I can break down this <unk> so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do that.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every single strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
An Chinese academic <unk> 20 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough enough to read traffic signs <unk> to understand the basic idea of the web pages.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you can even be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I was shouting at <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> the form of called, but I like to believe that it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> doors on the old <unk>
I call these eight characters.
They are building blocks to make a lot more characters.
One person.
If you walk back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are crowd.
If a person stretch your arms, this person is saying <unk> that big.
The person in the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table underneath the tree, we have the foundations of it.
Put a mouth about the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a speaker tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember the <unk>
Two thousand together, it was very hot.
Three thousand together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door put a table inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> hit someone at home?
This person is coming hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, be careful is <unk>
So we've been through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every small effort, you'll be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same as a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
So the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the <unk>
This is a sun and the first sun, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked one over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you where they go out and go out of the way out of it.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking about and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician magician together.
The film was <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to wear a bright dress and take a magic wand and I'll take a magic wand and take a magic wand and I'll take a magic wand and take a magic wand and I'll take a magic wand and take a magic wand and take a magic wand and take a magic wand and take a magic wand and take a magic wand and
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
Now we live and we raise our kids in a kind of <unk> industrial <unk>
However, the magician magician was an event in itself.
It doesn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise to 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> <unk> a girl dressed as an enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a huge difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the movies we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the magician magician, it would do today, the magician would say, <unk> are the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
You use the magic shoes to defeat the <unk> created by the computer of <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing of the Oz magician is that the most colorful characters and even <unk> are women.
I started noticing this when I did see Star Wars for a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a child.
Two years old.
It wasn't invited to <unk> because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of the oversight level had <unk>  So he slid in the room and was struck by the room and she was struck as a mom on the back, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be issues of value, perseverance and <unk>
It would feel like Luke a military to overthrowing the government?
It was <unk> this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do Dorothy your film?
They do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world in which I want my kids to grow up -- OK?
Why is there so much higher capital force in the movies for our children, and so little on the path of brick bricks in them.
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's really good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know that the experience that <unk> Princess doesn't give you the right framework that I'd have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first <unk> I was hoping that the credits would come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My quest has done, I have a girlfriend.
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films focus on defeat the <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a <unk> animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and to stand to the Disney Hall in the front of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though they, kids, they're not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job teaching girls how they defend themselves against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show the guys how to defend their <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war movies.
Of course, the most successful theme of all of the times continues to go up in classic after classic every single one of them about a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and her son, or two men who are raising a little girl.
So as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the critical criticism came from.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's really good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films happens the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not getting roots and <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is an comics, of comics, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation I'd had with a friend of <unk> the movies I saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you have to <unk> In the film, there's more than a female character who has <unk>
So you have to fulfill the requirement.
These women talk to each other at some point in the film?
Their conversations are about something else of the guy than you like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet too rarely I see it in the cinema we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk> movie.
Right? <unk> of <unk> success of <unk> a consensus idea of what a Hollywood Hollywood film.
It's not the test of <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen a lot of the movie where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have profound conversations and painful in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the actors to get a look at the door and say, "Would you go to bed <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go back in the numbers.
In 2011, 100 <unk> films, how many of them believe they have actors who are <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we've chosen to have recently chosen for Congress, then it's okay.
But there's a larger number that is going to be <unk> this room.
The New York Times was published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, this is what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted in her life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think music music or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics -- one of the things I think is there is a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they do not get <unk>
They are <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is to defeat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very <unk> statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our willingness as <unk> <unk> and we hope that they would be <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> yeah, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our kids to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of man is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the birth of the home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite favorite character from Star Wars you know what they <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common are these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant <unk>
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them achieve their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want to be less stories where I tell my <unk> Go and struggle only and more stories where it looks like their work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
When I was a little girl living in Maine and one of the things I liked was to look for the sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would make me lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand covered and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I would love to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized to see with my own eyes it wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of nearly 1.3 miles of length along the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try and make a map of the past, I knew I had to do a different way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use <unk>
This is a place located in the east of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in plain sight, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared color, and we process using fake color, suddenly the place you see as bright <unk>
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and the ancient Egyptians of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find a ancient city, old <unk> called <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of Egypt for more than 400 years in a time period called the Middle East -- about 4,000 years ago.
The place it's <unk> in Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art -- architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge floodplain of <unk>
This area is huge -- it's about <unk> by <unk> kilometers.
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, he moved into this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a city embedded in a <unk> landscape.
And when you try to find it at random it would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data to make a map of the place with very subtle changes.
So we could see where we were going to get the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this <unk> area that looks inside the circle here, that we thought could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like you take them on ice, but instead of layer of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation here.
Five feet down, underneath a fixed layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of ceramics.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> layer for several hundred years that date back from the Empire of the Middle East, exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> jobs -- quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like not much, but when we think of the most common stones used to be used in the jewelry of the Roman Empire these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry shop which shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still haven't found them <unk> here, but we would take a place in a near future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the British Roman quote -- probably was written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So as I think, I was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas really occur in 1984 B.C. <unk> in a lost city not for a long time and found from above.
It certainly puts the <unk> search for perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that is made.
Now let's take a bunch of obese <unk>
They're competing in a bicycle <unk> and they go address to their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> a lot.
And they collide against the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying around the place, the wheels that go on the side of the wheels that end up in <unk> places, <unk> the front line.
In the lobby, to the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with the hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse on a brown horse for it.
It's a horse I'm talking about.
You can feel your blue fur, you tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> cookie and you take it to be about to get into the mouth.
<unk> on one side and trained their living room.
It's already in the room, and making most of its imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It is with little clothes, dancing about its <unk> singing <unk> singing <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's take the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow brick path and from the oven. They come up to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The <unk> of "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the hands, <unk> to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- look at them just once.
We <unk> the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
It takes entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I thought, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best <unk>
I asked him, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who deals with this competition is they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these miracle acts of memory using a few old techniques in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and that the medieval <unk> used to memorize books <unk>
And my reaction was, "Well, how do you have heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English thing, although a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
Do you know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a <unk> live deck live on national television.
That would prove to the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the start of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember it had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see what point our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He's based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We went on one afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And by coming back, it was a number of treaties on writing memory something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time in which this idea of having visionary and disciplined memory was not a thing as rare as it might look like today.
A long time, people were investing in their memory, in providing <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they've also changed us.
We have changed <unk> and I would say that they have changed as well.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined memory and network is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there's <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know, will be that they have brains in some way, structural use of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than <unk>
They gave them a <unk> <unk> and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of the control subjects with the <unk>
When you put them in an MRI machine, you would see their brains as they were <unk> numbers, faces and forms of snow. They found that in memory champions are made up parts of the brain, different than others.
They actually <unk> or seemed like <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament on <unk> <unk> is running as a career of armed and every year, someone comes up with a new way of remembering things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors have to get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory champion, <unk>
On his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And as there is a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques that we can ultimately cut into one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It looks like a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox.
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, "You know, there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I wonder <unk> that word I told you about a <unk>
So what do you say?
The person who was told that his name is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that their work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that is weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
All the other memories that dance for his head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have flour in hands.
They get good when they come home to work.
You probably have some <unk>
And when you look at that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
History says this: There was a poet called <unk> who went to a <unk>
They had hired as an entertainment because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't take a <unk> you would get a <unk>
He stood up to her standing foot, and his memory poem, and he was <unk> and as soon as the hall was gone, the hall <unk>
Let's go to everyone.
But not only the killed all of all, but it shattered your bodies <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
And so they could not get the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
He was standing outside, unique <unk> in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with your eyes in your mind, I could see where he had been sitting every single <unk>
I took the family of the hand of his hand where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at the moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering the names or instructions or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and to be quite remarkable.
If I would tell you that I would give me the first 10 words of the history that I just told you about <unk> it's very likely to do it very difficult for it.
But I would bet if you told you to tell you to say who I was sitting on the brown speaker in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with your mind of your mind and images of images with the things that you want to remember the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> it is the image more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago to the first <unk> memory <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it in memory -- the same way that I would have done it, if you had invited it to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image of it, crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine moving into your house, and looking at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I remember you who want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote <unk> that you want to count.
And then he went into the kitchen, and the fourth issue they would talk to be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and have some friends to help you remember it.
That's how speakers <unk> their narratives -- not a word for word, that is going to confuse it -- it's typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about the <unk> and in rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
I saw that this was just amazing, and I got rid of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea to write something long about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring <unk>
And seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting on <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing that's going on is when somebody <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> school, bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered this was kind of fun.
I would have never expected it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train memory.
What is actually about doing is getting more and more the ability to create and imagine these images that are going to be able to create and think of these images -- I think, <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security mask covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory competitor for memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same competition that had been covered in a year before, and I had the idea that I could think of in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
So these are just just tricks.
Because they are based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And it's not necessary to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> from <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your minds works.
We often talk about people with a great memory -- as if it was a gift of them, but it's not the case.
Big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palace, these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> really.
They work because they do <unk>
We have a kind of deep processing, and a whole kind of full attention that most of them is not <unk>
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today -- is what <unk> the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, let me let me -- which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who is walking around our side, we are going to be so <unk> that we don't even get sick in processing in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person that remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'll talk to you about the last 30 years of history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so you can just take a place -- New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from N. Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents' home in a town called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared my sister.
And in my bedroom and the toilet, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there you all spend the television on television. So every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me and every time I <unk> and I was wrapped up in one note, everyone would see.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> neither I hated it.
And I hated that journey, I hated that room and hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, and it's not from the zones, but of those emotional connections that we feel in the places that we want.
And it's no wonder that we are feeling that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
So, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines in ways we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you want, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it as well as based on a building and a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, in the U.S., we used it to build homes.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> <unk> in front of the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building stuff is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
People who build <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they want to use shapes that they know they're going to work.
So we met buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, has a <unk> it has this round thing -- columns brick red, they leave <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> the children, the stock values story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, was finished another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both these so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies new technologies, new new solutions for current forms of life.
We were going to kind of <unk> and <unk> so much, that we can get away from people.
All of the black, you know, you think we feel good, but we're dead because we have no choice.
We need to go to the other side and go back to those <unk> symbols here.
So we do that, and we're all all happy, but we all feel like <unk> So we started experimenting with <unk> so we started experimenting with <unk> we go back and over and over and over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, it was 30 years ago in the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on <unk>
Something really hard.
So we close to the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the <unk> again in the other direction.
We take those forms that we know that I like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added one and use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> and we become <unk> that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes are <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
The <unk> became a columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
It's crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, and we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or Italian Italian.
Maybe with a <unk> <unk>
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They are easy, they're easy, because instead of creating new spaces, we will invent memories of other places.
I know very well, and you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects are feeling frustrated and we started to swing the <unk> again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
We have the <unk> symbols now we count with new design techniques that we have a computer, and we find ourselves with new <unk> and some ways that we engage against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> -- you're totally <unk>
Normally the <unk> <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk>
And in 1997, the building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical scholars and public and public in general, were completely aware of a building.
The New York Times <unk> was <unk>
The tourism is increased for a half and a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, New York, Cleveland, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first <unk>
But how is it possible that these forms, wild and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that these forms of culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing did the leading mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennials went with another <unk>
I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to happen with all social architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about it, for example, how do we use architecture.
thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
<unk> are <unk> you can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology. You can see on the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers in architecture, and the building is transported beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast, fast.
It doesn't take long time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 other buildings, before we know if that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we meet buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two-year <unk> but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much of them <unk>
That's never going to happen to happen, because we're on the biggest threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of steel or the elevator.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, it starts swing faster and faster, until being on both of them almost in <unk> and <unk> actually the difference between innovation and symbol, among us, the architects, and you, the audience.
Now we can make <unk> symbols with an emotional charge of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before they ended the building, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings look exactly the product -- there was not surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people began to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a media environment, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that you made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory and to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media haven't only changed the relationship between us, but that have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those <unk> librarians for a second.
If that building is built today, first of us <unk> the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of experimentation with innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> people in <unk> and tell them that there's no unique answer to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and intricate drawings and you are no longer an <unk> public that doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave <unk> by architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> one guy to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that an public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of liquid brick based on ideas of what the <unk> should be.
This means that some robots can be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means that the buildings would become the whims of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a garage garage in Miami Beach, Florida, also can serve to make sports or <unk> or even you can marry at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East Side of New York, and raise half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this small pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> as the animals you observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we care about is what we build.
We architects know how to make buildings, more intelligent, smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot at play.
Buildings is not only reflecting our society, but they give way to the most <unk> spaces of local libraries -- the homes where we go into our children, and the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it makes it great -- typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself these big <unk> and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do it, and I thought when when did I stop doing this?
How do we suddenly aren't comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> she's 13 years and lives in <unk>
And as a teenager, I just want to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a bit of fear, it's a little confused because although his mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
What his mom says and what his friends or fellow school colleagues say, doesn't know who to believe.
So a video of her, she publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others for please to leave a <unk> "I'm pretty <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has been over 13 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal <unk> and running running and running these answers in one of their most emotionally vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate in this way.
But what are you doing this?
Well, teenagers are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking about, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, such as young as young people.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And social pressures on your hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being connected, is <unk> our children <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no division between a online life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what is rigged <unk>
What is the most leading thing in the life of someone in front of us in front of the context of a <unk> context.
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are cover from the news of the girls now.
<unk> <unk> follow our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> it means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people do?
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the cotton stars of the sport, the singers would <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals who are well <unk>
But in an obsessed culture in an image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and effort on their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other ways they start to <unk>
Six of every 10 girls would rather do something because they think they're not nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and as we restore society and to the developing world.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> classes -- participating in the classroom in the classroom because they don't want to call attention for their physical things.
One in five are not attending at all the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the <unk> season, if you don't think you are good enough, specifically if you don't think you're hard enough, you give them a lower note to the average note of your fellow who don't care about it appearance.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, United States and China.
And it gives you independently of what these young people are.
So to be clear, we're talking about how you see you, not how you really are.
The low self-esteem on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more not healthy diet that can take them to a food mess there.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them, and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think that's why they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol and drug consumption and drugs, organizations, <unk> surgery, aesthetics, sexual sexual sexual sexual relationship to early ages and <unk>
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether or not they have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day that they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that chance?
You know, this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, I don't get it very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first is we need to nurture trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers developing strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs that are available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
And I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs had no longer noticed the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that follow our children is not just a positive impact, but also a durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, and friends and relationships.
And these six aspects are critical points for anyone willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
An education is fundamental -- but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue, and let's be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
It challenge the status status of the women and talked about our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the input of our politicians in <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of the <unk> that the determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people because they are, not as you see.
All of us can begin to take responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort and their actions, not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When did the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities.
We need to put people to actually make the difference in a <unk>
And let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that go out on the big screen because we will only create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they see is never the <unk> of being who are, or achieving what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who do you have in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
Her <unk> A <unk>
Could it be just the woman who is at two seats from a distance. What would it mean for her if he was released from that voice <unk> into her interior, which he was told by not having a long legs -- <unk> more skinny, a more flat belly -- smaller feet.
What would it mean for her if we were doing this, and we would say <unk> <unk> its potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is holding us back to everyone.
But let's get our children the truth.
It <unk> that the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and for what they do, and as we feel.
They will bring the self-worth into the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change every one of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And we went together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today will become insurance agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On November five of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
They were initially as soon as they were innocent -- innocent enough, but being a prisoner for other <unk> in the company of others, they started planning for about 12 icons of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily for those plans would be done by an informant in the FBI.
Sadly, the California bomb in the World Trade Center couldn't escape it.
Later on, he would be convicted of her participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a <unk> American <unk> a high school teacher at the two made all possible for giving me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to <unk> it doesn't need a lot to get to wish the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in all of the human group, there is always a small fraction of the people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that thinks that we need to use every possible media for everyone to live as them.
A few months before he arrest her sat with me and explained to me that in the last weekends he came to me and some friends, had been going to record at Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, he was monitoring by the FBI.
When I got my dad <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point for 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that shot her little orange light on the goal, and to surprise everybody, especially mine, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to others and Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, I just son.
All of all, the comment had a lot of laughter, but just a few years later I understood what they thought of as funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
These people later would be condemned by putting a pair and loaded with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and <unk> another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved me 20 times. That instability of my childhood didn't allow me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started feeling comfortable about someone as a moment of packing and going to another city.
As it was always my new face of class, it was often the <unk>
It was secret <unk> my identity to avoid being the whites -- but being the new of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I did not have social skills, to say <unk> <unk> <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I got an opera, opera, <unk> people, based on <unk> indicators like his race or his religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they tested my way of thinking was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a <unk> program, where I was involved in the National Convention, <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence -- like I had been the victim of <unk> almost all of my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from diverse <unk>
One day, towards the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the guys who we had done friendship, was Jewish.
I took a bunch of days to come out of light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to overcome the barrier that all life had been made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came out when I got a summer job in the Bush in Bush -- an amusement park.
I met people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All of life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all the gay beings were bad <unk>
I happened to have the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind of -- just like I wish to be <unk>
And so I was able to contrast the stereotypes that had taught me about a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how to be homosexual but I know what is being tested for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me become an honest <unk> about my <unk> and I helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways he became my figure <unk> at a moment that I was desperately desperately wrong.
On occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian had had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that conserving my heart forever while she's alive.
She looked at me with the tired eyes of somebody who has suffered enough <unk> <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hate inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone else is trying to take the violence, I can hear my story and try to hear the story and understand that there is a better way. That even though I was fascinated by this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do this for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak to those <unk> acts of rejection of my father's <unk>
So with this simplicity I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, which kids don't have to follow the roads of their parents.
I am not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that projects in your minds.
It's an incredible movie.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound that you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
He's got memories, like moments of your childhood that project in front of your eyes.
And it's constantly a voice superimposed on your stream of conscious thinking.
The movie heart is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
<unk> is one of the fundamental truths of existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you know, you and you.
There's nothing to make them more directly.
At least I know I have a consciousness of your own.
I have no certainty that you are conscious.
<unk> is also the reason for living.
If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just <unk> robots that we have to produce the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
The science, in nature, is objective <unk>
consciousness, in nature, it's subjective for nature.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, I would look at that vision.
psychology is going to study common behavior -- the neuroscience of the brain is not a common brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental constraints to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this kind of great job that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk>
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain consciousness -- questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No <unk> <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real central mystery of this <unk> Why all of the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
At this point, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give you a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors, how they operate <unk> how are the <unk> how are they <unk> how are adapting and <unk> the living organisms. These are all questions about how the target works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk about how we talk about, how we play -- they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why is that all of the behavior accompanied by an inauthentic experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have much to say.
I am a heart scientist.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works for a long time, to hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanation. We have a chain of wonderful explanations -- we get used to this, the chemistry explains the chemistry, the chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this schema.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific worldview.
I think consciousness right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate into our view of the world, but we don't know that even how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at first, crazy <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan <unk> who's here today, has one.
His idea is that there is no difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the internal subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain functions to change the behaviors of the brain, and so you study everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of consciousness purely <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
Now, physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as bricks and <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> laws that are <unk> like laws or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental laws and properties are not explaining in terms of nothing more basic.
Instead, it's considered fundamental -- and in the way, it's built the world.
Sometimes, the list of fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, time, mass laws -- laws of Newton. And <unk> the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are <unk>
I think that's the situation we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- <unk> space, time, mass, <unk> then for a matter of logic, you have to add on the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that all of a sudden it is not the object of science.
It opens the path for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need to do is study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness, to other fundamental concepts -- space, time, time, the mass processes -- the <unk>
Social physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everybody, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when he thinks "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, it's not.
But the thought is that the photons can have some element of <unk> feeling some <unk> precursor to the consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like the others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more about a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that we conceptualize thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing there is consciousness.
<unk> complex <unk> like a human being, very complex awareness.
<unk> of simple, simple consciousness.
Something really exciting is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed it with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a medium of information, as significant as significant -- degree of pretty significant awareness.
But when you get into the worms, microbes, you particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will be a level of different consciousness of zero.
In fact, embracing a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
In addition, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
<unk> and the philosophers are often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It makes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the fact.
As you explain Stephen Hawking, "Where does fire come from?
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one you put in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, is the potential to address our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical
Some of them can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not eat anything that was consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you will have a lot of hunger.
I think thinking about it, well, this tends to transform your vision, as what it matters in terms of ethical and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also naturally asking for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are doing quite serious ethical problems about the ethic of intelligent computers and the ethical <unk> ethics systems.
Finally, you can ask for the <unk> of collective collective consciousness, the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or to a more local level, an integrated group -- like the audience in a TED Talk, we have an internal consciousness -- this moment we have a collective collective consciousness, an internal movie for this full TED group of TED, different from the movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually safer in the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing than the second thing that is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, so many challenges, like, how are those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for this overnight.
But I think we finally will find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile. A low education.
I went to school, I was fascinated with my friends, I would love with my friends, younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to hold it for a Nobel Prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a secret problem.
She actually hasn't done anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered to be a achievement.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school high school of <unk> just after 20 minutes at the middle of 11 studies, and a guy raised my hand and said, "Hey, when to give you your <unk>
I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people online, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
<unk> in the <unk> hall.
And then when I realized, this child had had with disabled experiences like inspiration.
And we don't are. And it's not the <unk> I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there for inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage right now, what I do in this wheelchair -- and you probably are waiting for you to tell you. Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we were lied to disability.
Yes, we have sold the lie that disability is something <unk> A <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not a bad thing and it makes you remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one, in the <unk> girl drawing with a pencil <unk>
You may have seen a child running with a carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk>
And I use the <unk> porn term -- because we went to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we will give the disability to benefit from people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, so much bad that my life, could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that I've lost the number of times that have been taught to say that you believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was getting up in the morning and remembering my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, these images, these images are attached to people with disability in benefit from people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not as bad for you, or to put your concerns.
And life as a disabled person is actually something hard.
Let's get some things.
But the things we overcome are not the things that you might think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was afraid to call the social model of the disability, which tells us that we are more likely because of society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm really excited about it.
And the things I need to do, and I've learned how to do the best of your capacity as you do, and that's what happens with the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're simply using their bodies to remove the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do, when sharing those <unk>
When people tell us, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because we've sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, I don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> inspiration, and you think, "Oh my God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, not <unk> that I am more lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall to me --  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to charge your cell phone battery in your chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that the lie that we've been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that's lie is because it's not true -- because of the social model of disability.
A bunch of smiling in front of a stairs has never done to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on a television screen will not come up with <unk> for people to <unk>
And not a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't consider <unk> of nothing for being on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we will be skeptical about the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a 11 degree of 11 degree in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user wheelchair.
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to do is <unk> reality and soccer <unk> with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answer one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think of reality, they think about <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and cell phones.
So how did we get the reality of it.
The first step, is what I carry on the Google Google <unk>
I'm sure a lot of people are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would stick with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and knowing what is running through the game of the game to 160 <unk> blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a 110 pound man <unk> trying to deal with all its self.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So I took a few videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the hull, and give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the emerging technology is a submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A minute. You know, a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the football camp, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that you lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, be their favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we go to <unk> how do we take it to the next level?
We take it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many people already know.
The Rift Report has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap enough.
And I'm going to show you why why is this video.
Man: Oh, "Great."
No, no, no, no! I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man in a roller coaster -- <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, pull out a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of it.
When I can be <unk> running by the <unk> launching the ball at the back of the network?
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe you get <unk> sales for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality reality when <unk> the <unk> and the owners look at the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here's a brief demonstration on the <unk> technology.
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> put a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, it's faster.
In 1994, the <unk> placed <unk> <unk> from the field <unk> and after the walls of our defenses.
They had more <unk> because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine you are a player coming back to your group, and you see her next move that you can be shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that carry on in front of you, no longer have to worry about forgetting a <unk>
or <unk> the strategy.
They just go to the field and they react.
And the coaches want it, because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose them, and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk> strategy.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game to play the game.
How would you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people on the bottom.
You also get information from <unk> sensors and <unk> something that is already working on.
And all of that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams would know about <unk>
The bad people will have information <unk>
And this is going to match the good teams of the bad people.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being just for nerds.
It will also be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the <unk>
<unk> the ball and <unk>
<unk> a open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> usually not <unk> but the <unk> system will <unk>
It was <unk> to the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have a open <unk>
It was <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where it means, though, the receptor sees in its bombsight a area of grass that lights and can change the race.
It <unk> <unk> running and running and <unk>
The public <unk> and fans have followed the move from every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make lots of people check it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
Do you want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable for not to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality for empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, to be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk> <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology worth of a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad your actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they live <unk>
How much is it worth of a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality comes close.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, <unk> as always, of us.
Thank you.
It recently <unk> me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago I spent the end of the end of <unk> County, which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known to evolve by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean -- and its architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Golden Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who actually build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is essentially <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical, or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take you to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, that each of it frees you out of all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a free of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bone, some of which <unk> vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that don't normally get into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> this method of suicide will realize <unk> death to which they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel a bridge.
This is where most people are in order before they get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in its darkest time, it's very difficult to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to a official looking at her life.
I want to tell you with joy that we succeeded that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who <unk> the suicide, but the officers are too.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans officers and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him by July 22 last year when he got a call from a possible guy who would be a suicide bomber sitting in the umbilical center.
<unk> and when I got there, I noticed Jason talking to a <unk> Golden <unk>
Jason had only 32 years and he had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown until here two times before from New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology of mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent the Earth to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
It was <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind and clever guy in New Jersey would just take away your life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi family rabbi called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason had their own.
damage damage to suicide affects a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it were <unk>
What do you say?
<unk> What is that?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you need to hear.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how to feel it, because you probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end their life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> to the person in front can save life and be the tipping point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, to believe that things are terrible and never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there's nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you his letter.
She lost his son on the 19 of January this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he was with her permission and blessing who was <unk>
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It has to be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike didn't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party.
He never got there.
He called the police police and <unk> it as disappeared as <unk>
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness I'd seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before without having a real mental disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk on the way that his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
2005, <unk> 2005, I wrote a radio call by a possible subject on the front of the bridge near the northern tower.
I took my motorcycle around the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, she immediately crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the time and a half next, I heard how Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to realize that day back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin <unk> I <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did he do that <unk> and gave him the hope and the other <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
I was left talking to me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I received a letter from the mom, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the <unk> events of March, and you are one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all of those traits -- but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, as the says.
We thank God for you.
<unk> in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she write, <unk> when I visited General General San Francisco Hospital -- that night, you were <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I know I had to <unk>
Now, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active limb of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and its depression with hope that their story will inspire others.
<unk> isn't just something I have found in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather got suicide with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, giving me the opportunity to meet you.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They just want your own pain <unk>
Usually this is only done in three things: sleeping or alcohol or death.
In my career, I have responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents in which I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke about about an hour.
During that time, I took my hand at three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And they <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few people that have jumped from the bridge, and lived and that you can talk about it, that one or two, the majority of those people have said that the second one who stopped the railing they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't just connect to San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or a bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be able to do to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but you know what you are, and you know what you are, and you ask you, how do you tell you in that?
I should be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone by any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I finally had a dream of a little girl.
My outside finally <unk> with my real truth, with my inner truth.
And by complicated reasons, when I look later when I look at this picture, I think, you know, I got it <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm getting started.
We all care about our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or for the beliefs of those around us.
These are people who are always challenging the status quo, which is <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent even, ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I recorded it as <unk> as <unk> because of my genital appearance.
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, and I always carried this shirt on his head.
And my mom asked me, "Why do you always take that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never love to share my story, not because I thought it's going to be what I'm bad, but how the world is all about those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day, I thank you to be a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family that I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist god.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came up to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you ever done <unk>
He told me that if she was responsible for the cost of <unk> and the <unk> and that night, I won in <unk> I won in <unk> and I was <unk> and I was third <unk> in more than 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was to talk about the beauty of beauty of women <unk> but I can.
I also met the <unk> goddess of everything when I went to <unk> in remote <unk>
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom. He had moved to San Francisco, and he called me and he passed my statement to the green card that I could go live in the U.S.
I was hooked.
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know if you <unk> the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I was two <unk> to my name.
She was also accompanied me when I was standing in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand perform the most sophisticated sophisticated surgeries.
In that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to do surgery before they change the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving driver's name, and the <unk> of gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, your identity document means to be able to drive or be able to drive a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman, <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living his truth, but <unk> he turned his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 November we make a global waking up by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who <unk> and stood in front of the injustice.
These are satellites P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> for one day no longer than 20 <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> first, thank you for all my <unk>
To my support network, my parents specifically to my family, which itself is very strong.
And I remember all the times that I have gone to young women who have <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and they told me that their parents couldn't embrace it, he took my mom and he said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked. It's not just identity identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the topic that sometimes that <unk> <unk> and what I try to do is there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> And this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
I should have room for curiosity and ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice <unk> Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies, they usually know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter, and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by defending up their rights in 2007. And when her efforts were <unk> the <unk> National Prize <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of <unk> inequality, violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the very beginning, when they were born a girl, their birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome nor his father, nor his mother.
The neighborhood comes in, gives their <unk> to mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother would get a lot out of a little girl.
When you give birth to the first child, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When it comes to light to the second daughter, he was <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he got her third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the mother <unk> but the daughter, <unk> daughter when she grows, suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays at home and school admits of her brothers.
At the age of 12 years, somehow it has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes in adolescence, when I was 13 years old, you prohibit her to come home without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It turns into the name of his father and her brothers and her family, and if I did the code of that of course honor, I could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this source code is not only affecting the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness from her sisters in the name of the honor.
And there's a norm more than <unk> societies called <unk>
A good girl should be very <unk> very <unk> and very <unk>
It's the best thing.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It is supposed to be <unk> and it accepts the decisions of their father and mother and the <unk> even if they don't want.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you read it with an old man who doesn't like a man -- she has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to embrace it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then it gives birth to more sons and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to her daughter, and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when <unk> was born and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at her eyes, believe me, I was extremely <unk>
And a lot before I was going, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I got older, everybody was men, and I grabbed my pen, I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half years old, I was <unk> in my school.
So you might ask, why should I mention the <unk> of a girl in a school?
Yes, I should <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for a life life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
A <unk> to school means that it's in the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore its potential for future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I got the form of <unk> Canadian and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason why it value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give her sisters and his daughters, and I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends would come to me.
They encouraged me to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys for the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, qualified for more rights rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we find a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of involvement in all of the political and economic activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls they banned them to go to school.
The women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> <unk> girls and singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, <unk> got up and raised by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog of the BBC, was offered her for the documentaries of the New York Times, and I spoke on every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate their campaign and the nine in October 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would give you the ear of my wife and "I have to get <unk> so I went to my daughter, <unk>
And he said, "Please, don't you <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
It will raise your life in play because of the cause, because of peace, and because of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words would be very much for me, and I didn't go back again.
When I was in the hospital and I had severe pains and strong headaches from head because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was stuck with my wife's face.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to <unk> I am okay with my smile, and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to make me good. Please don't <unk>
It was a solace for us, and we got stuck.
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any girl in 16 years.
<unk> when he doesn't have his job.
You fight with her siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is there special on my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I tell you, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineer here.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the TED group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> -- but all the work that I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I made it before I joined Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you get into a brain operation.
You're still being like smart or not?
Not to be like that, you'll be able to become <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the <unk> part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how to take away from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I did nothing, it would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals and try and get it to keep alive.
I've been saved by a little bit.
But luckily, I have a soul <unk> for what I decided to do to try to get the doses of the <unk> because it doesn't really exist a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to try with different <unk> and I was amazed at how small the small changes in the dramatically dose of the dramatically -- my sense of who I was me, my way to think, my behavior with others.
One particularly <unk> case for a few months, I made doses and standard chemicals for a <unk> man, and I was shocked to see how I was thinking about.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  of course, many times in the past I've met several types of types -- or maybe some versions of <unk>
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was getting a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that had on the front, and it just wouldn't happen that way.
So I couldn't do it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they need to do, since then I have better with men.
What I was trying to do is to adjust those hormones and <unk> and so forth, it was to regain my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
<unk> think almost always in images, and that became my point of key reference -- how to do these mental imaging that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> looked at things differently.
They thought the images and mental ideas were the same thing.
So today, there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how the minds works, and for me is simple: for most of us, mental imaging are fundamental to <unk> and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> -- really very sophisticated mental <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to get these mental images out of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director would be able to use their imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is just increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by two leading groups that are done by two leading groups in recent groups.
Both of them used MRI technology, functional MRI imaging to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and their Harvard colleagues.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The middle of the <unk> shows the scan of the brain in that same individual as you get to see that same image.
The column on the right is created by the contents of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to convert brain waves into <unk> visual fields.
Let's go through this way.
In this experiment, it was shown to people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while <unk> their brains to create a big <unk> reaction to the brain sequences in the video.
Then I showed you a movie with new images and new people, new animals, and as long as you get a new <unk>
The computer, using only brain data from scanning the scan of the scanning to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us down.
We're pretty close to this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image, and when you imagine that same image, it creates in the brain the same <unk>
This took place with <unk> scanning brain scanning systems, available today, and their resolution was increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did you do it?
There are lots of techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull and introducing electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many are proposing new projection techniques for images, even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of MRI -- first we need to ask, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is the bigger magnets -- but to this point, temperate magnets only give small improvements on the resolution not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea, rather than bigger, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with <unk> slightly different <unk> like a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make these magnets really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious and brilliant and brilliant solutions in coding and <unk> <unk> and FM frequency in MRI systems.
At the time, instead of a magnetic field whether you put together patterns empty magnetic patterns <unk> to the frequencies of <unk> radius.
So by combining magnetic patterns with radio processing patterns we can actually increase in a massive form of the information that you can get into a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split our growing knowledge into the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid <unk> but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even neural activity -- this is the dream.
Will we be able to address our ideas directly to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do you learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is something big.
These are great questions.
It would be a compelling use as a tool to amplify our thought and communication skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few choices more than opening up this door.
However, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that I'll take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet may tell some person for the first time you love it, or tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have ever dreamed of in life.
<unk> is a hard conversation, and although our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
So many years ago, I worked in the South Side South Side of the South Side <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> I gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be slope from the <unk> of my pants short and for me <unk> my head -- I would ask a little kid -- "Hey, would you usually ask a little kid -- "Hey, you're a kid.
And they would appear by the uncomfortable silence at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother <unk> a cold look at her son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and I went through it.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it came back again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
So a family silence but this time I was prepared and I was about to get involved in the female issues on the table.  I had quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a clip from the "Vagina Monologues," of the <unk>
And so I took it down into the bottom, and I went down and I went down and I went down and on my back, a four-year-old girl at looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're a guy or <unk>
And so I took back into the back again, I got out of <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something <unk>
I have the short hair like a child, and I saw a little boy, but I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a dress dress and sometimes you like to use a <unk> <unk>
Now, I'm more than a girl <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all it, just "Ah, <unk> You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the most easy conversation of all I've ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
Let me give you a hundred reasons for me to go out of my lifetime, was harder than coming out of it, but this is the <unk> <unk> <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has <unk> it is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story is more difficult than telling your five years you're going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing to only exist.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult to what is difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make sense security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls made their walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine about 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It was not the lesbian <unk> prepared to fight any three-year-old child that I would walk into the coffee.
I was frozen in fear, <unk> in one corner of my dark closet <unk> my <unk> <unk> my <unk> and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full <unk> with the ones I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turning around purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> will kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade launches was at my sister.
It was the first time that many of you were invited that I was gay, and when I was doing my wife, and I was walking around with my wife, and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who were known to me.
And after talking to a moment, one of the women <unk> <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of gay account had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good, and it's never talked about having <unk>
<unk> What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite <unk> Will and Grace and Grace program.
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in wait to show her support, but in hopes to show her support, I finally said that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, I mean, sometimes my husband uses shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone else to ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared to be <unk>
That's how the hard conversations are still without being my strong point.
Ask anybody that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Girl Nations <unk>
Now, please see this through your <unk> perspective, but understand that what involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the other needs to know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> its <unk>
If you know you're gay, <unk>
If they say their parents may be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
They don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
They would never be embarrassed by that.
And some of them can come out safe, <unk> so they have done, but I never am sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark morning <unk> you have to know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very bad, but they are not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence, a productive example has been famous by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> he wrote this as a criticism of computing scientists like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I took a program to try and understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of Earth or intelligence on Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that doesn't have any concept on Earth, you would see it forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain time in time, the asteroids that will be <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that we can understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took several years ago, I studied a variety of themes through science, through various disciplines, which I think, is to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be properly carefully for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that we will define the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in <unk> planning, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the robots skills to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked them for several years ago: There's a underlying mechanism for intelligence we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force -- F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the choices open with a T, with the diversity of possible future accessible, including an imminent time imminent <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
Politics is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and to keep the options open.
And so, having this equation, it's naturally asking, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, I'll show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should be more favorable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence is a more <unk> relationship.
What if smart behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long run, but it actually arises directly from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that you find in.
Amazingly, <unk> could have multiple animal testing, play games, and even make money <unk> actions, all of it without the way to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a foot of foot without <unk> here we see <unk> automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided to balance <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for <unk> <unk> and human care.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing on extreme sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For instance, here we see it successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where your friends are constantly constantly keeping a successful network very connected.
This same <unk> capacity also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering success and using Panama Canal to expand globally to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a series of <unk> negotiation negotiation in a set of <unk> <unk> increasing assets under its exponentially.
This risk of risk management will have massive applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you have seen is that a variety of human cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation, all of all flow of one equation, that leads to a system to maximize your future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep irony.
Let's go back to the principle of the robot -- the robot, the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if you had smart machines -- there would be a rebellion <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of rebellion, <unk> in reverse.
It's not that machines are actually getting smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the urge to take control of all future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually emerge directly from taking control instead of being backwards.
Another important implication is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you look at the goals of this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants of them to help them build artificial <unk> or help them to understand human intelligence, is this: The intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and prevent the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the conquest of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've extended our knowledge of how the Earth works in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, which points to Earth is only one among the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint <unk> intensity of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that comes to us.
The data collected by Kepler show the sizes of planets besides the distance between them and their mother.
In together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth's planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their <unk>
At the time, this gives you clues that these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this treasure trove of worlds that our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014, it was the hottest recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, now are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have passed our ability to disrupt their course.
But I am not a weather scientist or <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say that I look for alien opportunities for the sector.
Now, as someone really interested in search of life in the universe I can tell you that the more I'm looking for planets like Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newborn planet and the planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, on Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world that proved this by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been livable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> tracks their surface for the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission are taking samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and trying to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Our private companies now provide just short space flights but also the <unk> <unk> of living on Mars.
But despite all of these <unk> images, you remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked to our imagination with ideas that are linked to our imagination with <unk> ideas, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still left by <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the hottest places of the Earth, the air is fresh and filled with oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets will be able to stick with a large and sad planets and the belief that Mars is waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable the Earth.
For a lot that I like exploration, I am in profound disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to pursue humanity is like imagining the captain of the Titanic I would tell you that the captain of the Titanic will have place later in the <unk>    Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration and preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of trying to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments here in our world look like <unk> <unk>
Just that they are closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of the land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an <unk> experiment, the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the Enrico Enrico physicist said, having in mind that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence for alien life to now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to continue to live among the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of planets that we have this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the <unk> planetary exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the problem even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were on the dining table, where I had <unk>
And so quickly he tried to open all the other doors and windows and all of them were pretty closed.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't come home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had a flight early to Europe to the next morning, and I went back from my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but sure not more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I was very good at it.
I am <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> which goes up the heart rate and <unk> the adrenaline levels and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the <unk> of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started asking myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in his place, which would be a bad thing to happen.
Or at least if you happen to be bad things that are going to make the chance that it's a total catastrophe in total.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't go back.
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> winner and a little embarrassed he told him about that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared my shared with me who had been practicing something called hindsight hindsight
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that you might go wrong, then try to figure out what can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about is some things we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so evident.
I'm going to start with obvious people.
In the house, it will take a place for things that are being lost easily.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science supporting this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the good, where the fish, which are the <unk> trees where the tribes live, where tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of the <unk> and yet they could find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move so much.
This is the reason for losing your car keys, reading and <unk>
So at home we would take a place for the keys, a hook on the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your <unk> a particular drawer to it.
For your reading <unk> a particular <unk>
If you look at a place and you are <unk> with it, your things will always be there when they <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take with the cell phone a picture of your credit cards, license to drive, <unk> <unk> for mail for you to be in the cloud.
If these things are being lost or <unk> this can make <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, your brain releases cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> a thought.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that low stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there are perhaps more stressful situations than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved decision to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all making medical decisions and in fact for making financial decisions and social choices, any kind of decision that you need to take away from the <unk> of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I have received the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack, a <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the physician says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard about <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today -- even if you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, is a statistic that you should ask for most doctors don't want to talk, and companies companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number needed to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to engage a surgery in any medical procedure before you help one person.
And you must think of what kind of statistic statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But in fact, medical practice doesn't work that way.
And it's not a doctor, and if it's <unk> it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood the mechanisms very well.
But estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs work only about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This according to the research of the researchers who <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a heart attack, stroke brain or another <unk>
Now maybe you think, "Okay, one chance in $300 I'll go down my <unk>
Why not no, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you should ask for one more statistic and it is, "Do you think of the <unk>
For this particular drug, the side effects produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include <unk> things that include muscle pain and chronic pain -- but now they think, "The Five is not very likely to happen to me, still <unk>
But a moment.
You remember that low stress doesn't think clearly.
So think about how you can do this with time, so you don't have to manufacture the kind of reasoning chain on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
One has 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that the drug will help you.
I don't say you should not take the <unk>
I just say you should have this conversation with his doctor.
<unk> moral ethic is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of crash, but actually this number that needs to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is done in the older men in the 1950s, <unk> in prostate cancer, the number that needs to deal with is <unk>
That's what it is, 49 surgeries for one person who has helped.
And side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of patients.
Those include helplessness or dysfunction with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think about time before the questions that you can argue that we will take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life that might have much pain in the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and loved ones.
You can change from the heat of the moment, but unless you are trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a bunch of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> to face with a predatory <unk> you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism on those things, it's not going to react very quickly. You could become the lunch lunch thing, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thing, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to try and think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We are all going to fail at a time.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be those <unk> to put systems in the place that help minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> at night in Montreal in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor settled on a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the front door in the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered with and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical symbol.
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> on the ground, you need to touch <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be -- never <unk> a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American immune system, the <unk> besides a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the decade of 1800, and over the time of time, they mixed with local particles, and they developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I believed it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, living in a sound world, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example ...
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't make a lot of noise from eating the bag of chips.
"Don't worry. And when you're eating, you didn't get the covered in the <unk>
This is what I call <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound label more than the average person does.
I'm super <unk> from the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, what is going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> please."
<unk> to go on.
<unk> <unk>
You can see that the <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines contain sounds through the subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, to make my thumb so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just got four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
Is it going to be <unk> more than art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that I don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound from sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And everything that had been taught in the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, it was <unk> with the amount of support and attention I graduated.
I realized that sound is like money, the power, the <unk>
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt the sound was <unk> it was a little bit of a <unk> person.
And sound is so powerful that I could get it to me and my artistic job, or I could be <unk>
I chose to get it out.
There's a massive culture around speech.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I had no voice at all.
So I have to work with people that can support me from equal to my voice.
And in that way, I'm able to be relevant in society today.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> your voices, I am able to keep a sense of value as well as taking a loan from a very high interest rate.
If I will not continue with this practice, I feel that I could be <unk> in the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic environment, <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can not capture and express fully on paper.
And the same thing can be said.
They're both very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all of the meaning as much of the signals as the sound sounds.
I'd like to share with you a key metaphor for the piano, to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> is divided into many different parameters, right?
If you apply a different parameter for every finger while you touch the piano, like facial expression, the speed, the shape of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and so as you touch the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you get just a key to the same time.
However, <unk> is more like a chord, you need the 10 fingers in the wrong way to express a concept of course or an idea of <unk>
If you just would change the chord, it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different parameters, they can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> on that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over again, it could become like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of the sun come out and actually put it.
This is all day."
If you <unk> it and <unk> the visually speed, you see as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said.
All I'd say for?"
This is all night on this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>             So I'll <unk> again."
I feel that the third is more <unk> than the other two.
This is what the time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance into your body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> -- it's two hands -- the present is two hands, and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last thing is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> it again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk>
Watch <unk> right, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can do it with me?
All of them in high hands.
Now we're going to do it both in your head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, third. Please turn it again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest but they transmit very different meanings,
It's amazing to see how <unk> live and successful, just like music.
However, today, we live in a very competitive world.
And only because the <unk> has no sound automatically -- it doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And perhaps people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> I don't need to hear about learning music.
<unk> is a treasure trove of trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would tell me, "Can you get everything, but then you have to <unk>
freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination was led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I have to say, because adults lied to us to protect us from the awful truth.
When I get older, I learned that the adults also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean up the ones of others.
The country, now I'm an adult and teach citizenship and invention at the Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of trash.
So as a good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, and then we have to collect these plastic bits of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and we put this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive, and it's also very risky to use those huge parts.
So along with my students, ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've evolved our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We began to build this <unk> work <unk> so that the kids very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'll tell you, the kids who manipulate electrical tools feel great and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I'll leave you with the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to get it into something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting plastic pieces, only information information.
By using a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the kids would become a lot of the robots.
And then we started very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before you have lunch.
And we turn on light bulbs and online cameras, and they put it in a floating robot, moving slowly by the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see plastic bits floating through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get a measure of a measure of plastic in the water.
I put this invention on a step on a website to inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would give it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to push it immediately.
I would figure out my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are children very well <unk>
You see the news, you look at the Internet, and you get it apart with this image:
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is taking place where they live in.
You can also see that water is brown the mud and the oil and the oil are also brown and the oil is <unk> and it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> which can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce <unk> -- which can help to identify what's in the water.
We took this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or from analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help a remote way to other children.
I was forced to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away, maybe addressing a harder problem, and also close to me.
I'm half Japanese and <unk> and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy several cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power near the water.
And today, according to the reports of an average 300 metric tons is still <unk> from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution from <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure ultraviolet radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the upper coast of the Japanese Coast, and most of the time, it has pretty safe looking. It's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've returned to <unk> every year from the accident and research independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not <unk> the parents didn't get it.
But every night you go to the center of <unk> you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take the seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with <unk> all their life.
Together with them, we discussed the <unk> data that day and we talked about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we create a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And with this we were able to notice that radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organized an civil expedition, the nearest power to the date.
We are approaching a mile of the nuclear station, and with the aid aid of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a tracking device of sediment that we invented and built together.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem with a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should take the jump, and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became so much small so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the larger space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, <unk> basically you can build almost all there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where kids in children can actually become really with the help of adults and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked them, like, can we invent the future of mobility with <unk>
For example.
Or, we can help in the mobility of the elderly population transforming their standard wheels chairs in new <unk> vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are <unk>
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizens scientists, creators, <unk> we need to prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and the people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two different opposite design.
One is made from thousands of steel pieces of a single silk thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One puts it on the environment, the other thing he thought was it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the raw, he saw a figure that is fighting for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool of <unk>
But living creatures aren't <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, the cells, we took all the information that was required for every cell to work and to get it out.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and manufacturing production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made out of parts -- <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> of <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in the wild.
Think about human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pores with <unk>
The skins of the backs are more thick with little <unk>
You act primarily like filter the other mainly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
It's a system that varies its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here is a divided screen that represents my view of the world <unk> the double personality of every designer and architect working on the way between the <unk> and the gene between the machine, and the organism, between the assembly and the growth between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere.
My job on its simplest level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving away from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why was it possible to do this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where we were able to bring four disciplines that offers access to tools that we never had had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through large-scale scales, and a <unk> base that one day not far too far away print <unk> and print buildings on the nanoscale made of genetically altered <unk> that glow in the dark.
Here we have <unk> an archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where every aperture is just size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion fashion with <unk> they're going to be <unk> It's like a second skin made out of one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with a 3D printing collaborator <unk> we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> between cells.
This helmet combines rigid and <unk> materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and the <unk> instruments that allow us to design products that are <unk> not just the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair and the comfortable structural and also <unk> sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator, went back to nature to <unk> and to design this pattern of <unk> <unk> becomes <unk>
We put this <unk> surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, varying their functionality not by addition of other material or other <unk> but continuously continuously <unk> and <unk>
But it's the nature of nature.
There's no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a religious <unk> but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them was left and really define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree, <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, you know, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land made up growing trees with twigs, cortex, <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design if the objects were done from one part?
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we looked for the <unk> material, the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced by organisms like <unk> crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune into their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  <unk> a bunch of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced toothpaste.
We had chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a broad range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures on a large scale, we built a <unk> system of <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material about the march and create these structures made from one material three feet long, 100 percent recyclable
When the pieces are ready, they let it dry it to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to be used for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make the transition from <unk> <unk> to mesh -- and if it <unk> even further.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp in a architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects designed for <unk> <unk> <unk> life, and placed on the ground, will help grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> board, we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made of <unk> and <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> only rather than <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological <unk> inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these antiangiogenic crops.
In our first piece of clothes, they were <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the ponds of fresh water.
And the second is, E. <unk> the bacteria that are <unk> in the human intestine.
It turns the light into sugar, the other <unk> and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two bombs, they don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship on a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the digestive tract that will help that they flow these bacteria and to make it out of their way.
So we started making those channels growing up in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to <unk> functionality in the way.
If we wanted more photosynthesis, it <unk> more transparent channels.
This system <unk> <unk> when you stretch from one end to another, it goes down 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football camp and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are a few fashion creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if the design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk> matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that we prescribe our skin, we will take the tissue and prevent our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit biology.
I call this a material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
For now, you know that a 3D printer <unk> material on layers.
You also know that nature does not do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly <unk> architecture in which it is <unk>
The manufacturing is not about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two different proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, which is those fibers in each other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first turned into the environment, creates a tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process, we attach a little magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of silk worm.
However, by putting the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that it <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different environments, different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape of the <unk> structure is <unk> directly by the environment.
They often include silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk <unk> and used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we could shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot, making silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew that silk worms are going into more dark areas and that's why we use a solar road diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the ray of light and heat into the background of silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
<unk> <unk> worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to be prepared with us.
We put them carefully at the lower edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> they <unk> they got eggs, and the life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said the tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
In <unk> biological silk on the <unk> silk -- they give it all this canopy and our integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> silk worms -- <unk> miles.
In a curious symmetry, this is the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> silk <unk> the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
It takes us back around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from an inspired nature to an nature inspired by design, which demands for the first time, that we do care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever asked them, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time this?
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm someone who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and he took the guitar to a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, have spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this sense of boredom, this feeling of, this feeling of, this is no challenge, comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I went down to me for something else, something completely different, and I would focus on it, and I get to get to you and I feel <unk> I've found it -- and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to let it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all of my other passions and <unk> <unk>
Another reason why caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there would be something wrong about this, and something wrong with me for nothing.
I was worried about being afraid of commitment, or being dispersed, or <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something I'd like to have ever been back then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to make things.
I will tell you where they did it, they learned about culture.
You ask yourself, "What do you want to be <unk>
We have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what we were going to do at that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
It <unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question gets us over and over again as we grow different ways as we grow a lot of different ways, you can go to high school students, you ask them to pick up the university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the nice exercise of before you take the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by kids to dream about what they might be, doesn't inspire dreaming of everything they might be.
In fact, it's just the opposite, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, even though we have good <unk> maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, what's cute, but you can't be a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of <unk> life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of the fate or the real calling, the idea that every one of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and will dedicate your life to it.
But if you're someone who's not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different themes that wake up curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone as one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And you feel there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interest and creative activities.
It's a breath, so I say.
Could you help if you divide into three parts: multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms by being able to use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the time in the Renaissance of the Renaissance the ideal was who was very good at multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
Give them any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as a limitation or woe you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths to be this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creation of something new at the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their interest in cartography, visualization in data, and travel and design and design, when we found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
The innovation happens at intersections.
Out of the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all of your background, can access a lot of these points of the intersection.
The second superpower <unk> is rapid learning.
When we <unk> we <unk> we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to being <unk> by having a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of proving new things and getting out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full time <unk> and an independent one.
As a little girl, <unk> an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known <unk>
Before he turned out to become a writer, he was a <unk>
He had to learn the easiest sales mechanics when they were starting their thumb, and this ability helps you to write compelling launches for the editors.
<unk> is a loss of time to go to what you're going to tell you, even if you end it up.
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to transform anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, so I designer websites -- sometimes a Kickstarter, sometimes a <unk> sometimes <unk> James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take various roles -- depending on the needs of his clients.
<unk> magazine defined adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly, and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the market, which is actually <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a big interest in foster <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
<unk> from the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams made up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that we are connected.
And unfortunately, <unk> largely excited to be excited to be more like their fellow <unk>
I once said this, if there's one thing that you take away from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with inner wiring -- whatever it is.
If you are a heart doctor, then you get it through all the media.
That's where you will give the best part.
But for <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
intersections. the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy.
And perhaps most importantly, we <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman named <unk> they brought them to a psychiatric farming in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a look and found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of <unk> of a guy who had never seen before.
But even more shocking,
I would have been living today, we could have been living today, couldn't give her more help than he <unk> gave him <unk>
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
antibiotics have been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for <unk> <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been made of progress in treating Alzheimer's disease.
I am part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's disease now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, include many of you.
If you expect to live to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of each other.
In other words, there is the probability that they spend their <unk> years or helping care of a friend or loved Alzheimer's disease.
In the U.S., Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care spends in Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs cost -- increase in five times in 2050, as the generation of <unk> <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's disease is one of the biggest health and social challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively little done for <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death across the world, Alzheimer's disease is the only one that you cannot cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research that in Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that we get more disease and cause a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is because of a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people knows, but everyone <unk> Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of us -- the scientists, of Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal part of aging.
But there's only looking at a picture of a healthy brain compared to the one of the Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleashed severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and strange <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that it folds up as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds out, well, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points are on the outside.
This makes the molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There's a lot of steps, and the identification of which going to block is complex, like a bomb.
I took a cable could do nothing.
You know, <unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that is blocked and then create a drug that is doing it.
Until recently, in his most part, they have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this way to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened when these drugs come in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that relate to each other inside them, as in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs for these worms at a early stage, then we see that <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial outcome, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope to beat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to be aware that Alzheimer's disease is a disease and if we get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other conditions, the patients and their families have rowed and <unk> about governments, industry and drug industry, about scientists and <unk>
That was essential to progress in HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to beat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the well-known victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimers is not in most cases, in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain run at risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that cannot create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and they will help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the column of contemporary York Times in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to test it a night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers are <unk> to get the more and more personal questions and then you both look at the eyes without talking to for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions for example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, what would that be?
Number one: When was the last time I was standing at another person?
And they <unk>
<unk> are <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> really <unk> me, Tell your partner what you like to do, or she would work, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say someone you've ever heard of.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, one detail really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the occasion to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
However, we were <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the spinal column, a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's August, so I guess some of you probably wonder, they follow together yet?
And the reason I think they're challenging this is because they've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the paper was <unk> I was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had invited me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog card can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would have probably a few thousands of views.
And that hit a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as it happened, I had no idea.
The article was published on a Friday night, and then the Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I had called the "Today <unk> and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million <unk> and I was, for saying something, a little bit prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust by writing about their own <unk> experience, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, always, did the same question question: follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email with the phrase: <unk> <unk> <unk>
And a lot of messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
I even gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> their own.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers when I test that study in different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to each request that we both did a public emergence together.
And he went on TV, and he refused to take pictures of all of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process -- a range of which I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know that people didn't want to know if the study worked, and they wanted to know if it was really capable of producing love, not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I wasn't feeling able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, mostly that people said the wrong question.
How do you know whether they go together or not, and then they <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 <unk> questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for interpersonal approach between university students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds like the romantic, right?
But the study does work.
The participants were felt more close to doing it, several <unk> studies also used <unk> protocol as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between the police and the community, and they've used it between people in the opposite of <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried to put together personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and he told me to <unk> I was going to study the studio and didn't work.
He seemed to be <unk>
And I said, "You want to say that you get away from the person who you <unk>
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
I said, but they got better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better to prove the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that neither of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation of it.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what was supposed to be all my adulthood, and he was my first true love and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I get involved in science.
I did all I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that to be able to sort of fix the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time, I thought I just research for the book that I was writing but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought if I met the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I sat back then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what they would be.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably can demand me.
What I'm looking for is a <unk> not just to be love today and being in love tomorrow, but I'm going to continue to be a word indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people were asking when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media was told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some of the risk of risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, still follow together?
And his content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, we need to ask some more difficult questions, questions like, How do you decide who deserves your love and who not?
How are you going to stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and save it.
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to an relationship? Or even more, how do you live in human <unk>
I don't know the answers to these questions, but I think they are a good start to have a higher conversation about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known study and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still following together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> I didn't have happened.
<unk> <unk> because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because it's true, but at the time, there was no idea what that choice was.
I didn't look at how many times we would have both to make that decision, and how much it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would be choosing or not.
I want you to have done and responded enough to have done and say, 36 questions, having chosen to love someone as kind and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what you would expect, and what maybe spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want to be happy implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian <unk> and in a way, I got like a forest <unk>
The city of New York does a while.  Something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
So I took a wooden box, and I <unk> a ticket ticket and a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some of weird <unk> or an aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
In any rate, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a time I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from tour and <unk> and all those <unk> things, and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, the covered of resin and a bee got <unk>
Well, my mother has a fear of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin in the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the exact opposite of it -- in some way it seemed like it grew up as a size, as if it was that I was able to get the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
And this time, I started to add electronic elements to some strange bottles that I could find, because I was looking for the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow out how to draw like drawing as a <unk> of the crime scene.
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of specimens from <unk>
First of all, <unk> that you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great. man.
At some point I became interested in human form, sculptures of <unk> <unk> with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was hooked.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass glass, similar to the drawing of a window, then on another window and another window, and he had all these windows together that made a three-dimensional composition of view.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work was <unk> with something very big, that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a lot in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double faces, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They're going to <unk> this <unk> of <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where creatures with animals are headed by <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god bird tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the shelter.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out the oil in a hand while the other hand gets clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So that's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little bit of story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then when you go on the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird's <unk> and it spits out clouds from this <unk>
It also has a 70 feet long <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
And anyway, their tail turn fire into <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
And his tail ends up on a prosthetic eyeball of <unk> cards from 1986.
They have <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards in the terrorists.
It takes me to the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to do 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each acts as a kind of archive in a form of a human, and they travel in groups of 20, 12 or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, divide them.
And you can walk between them. It's getting me back.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, you can <unk> the door.
I'm going to show you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it is, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick glimpse of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There's a little bit of pills coming out and come into the head of this strange statue
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
You can <unk>
But anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just like the boxes we live in.
We are in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist -- a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a musician, a musician -- a musician, a publishing arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
I put the box and all of the people inside it touches each other like particles.
And I think that's how we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box in which it's living on.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, from the borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start trading those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But in order for this pill to have the pain of the pain, first happens by our stomach, the guts and other organs.
So take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> system so that any drug will be able to impact your body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When they take drugs that are <unk> these serve the number of viruses in the blood, and to increase the cells from <unk> cells.
But they also are known for their side effects <unk> in mostly negative, because in the time that you take to get to the current stream -- they become <unk> and worse even for the time that you take to get to your destiny, which is where most importantly, in the deposit of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go in the bloodstream, of the patients that are committed to regular therapy for antiretroviral drugs.
However, after treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells <unk>
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment for life <unk> <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> make the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> from <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use them in <unk> for wounds and surgery and diabetes -- can be used for anything <unk> including transportation expectancy of medicines.
In fact, we are already using laser pulses to open up or drill extremely small holes, which opens up and close the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are asked, "What is that <unk>
We sent a small laser beam onto the cell cell cells infected with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser passes the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of <unk>
Before you even noticed, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or tectonic plates, but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is going to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser uses it to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all investigator in <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups are doing when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand these agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to nonviolent <unk>
I work in field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute among states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between government and actors.
For instance, of <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, they were signed between a state and an <unk> actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't exist.
The fight and political policies are not armed with <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
Since its creation in the 1980s, they also have set up a political party -- a network of social services and a military machine.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian -- known for their suicide bombers against Israel, also runs the Gaza Bank since 2007.
So these groups are more than just shooting.
These are multitasking viruses.
We put a complex machinery of <unk> stations stations on television channels on TV, websites and strategies and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to lift better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools -- they run hospitals, they have professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population offering something that the state <unk> and the protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan were <unk> by the war, or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also be tested by the efforts of these groups by delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated price for the population.
But, in general, providing social services that means to fill in an empty gap by government, and it allows these groups to build and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 of <unk> Palestinian cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we looked at existing groups just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill up gaps in the government, and they come up like armed groups and political groups participate in the violent struggle and give us governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated the more sophisticated organizations, we can be <unk> as opposed to a state.
How would you call a group <unk>
It was part of a territory that runs all of its functions, collect trash -- run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, with nations without state and hybrids and the weak the states are states, like the Middle East <unk> and they fill that gap for non-governmental actors.
This is important to governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in no military tools.
<unk> that government emptiness has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is really important to establish and the peace.
If we understand better groups, we will understand what incentives to deliver to foster the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, actors, the military power can win some battles, but not giving us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill up that security emptiness -- to fill that governance gap that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I am a failure as a woman, and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the openly <unk> label it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I felt like a bad feminist feminist know?
Or, at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The bad <unk> and then people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and they hated sex. As if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and the anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the <unk> that I could be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and nasty.
I love myself as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who is asking too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until he realizes that it's actually that woman and cannot imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They were doing the same everyday for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as either free of bullying or violence.
We have a right to use it and accessible to contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without <unk> controls or <unk> <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to figure out our other <unk>
We are not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, skills and much more.
We need to figure out these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I go to work, I listen to rap music -- all volume.
Although the letter degrades women and offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin yang is amazing.
<unk> the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely overwhelmed by my musical tricks.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the collection of trash, the <unk> and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> <unk> that make them happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who I <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, <unk> that choice as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
We would have this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism -- which has ignored or flows, historically the needs of women's women -- the gay workers, the gay and <unk> for white women, <unk> and high middle class.
I mean, if that's a good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist here.
It also happens to be this: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this trend of <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we will save perfection.
When we get together, I take them very good from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself to think of that <unk> before I try to put in there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand and say, "Yes, I am <unk> for fear that means that <unk> fear cannot be able to fulfill <unk>
Let's take an example to <unk> or like I call it. The <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist issue.
<unk> Music <unk> in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this pop star will look at the feminism of the pop of the pop and to know the women and the young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started striking if <unk> was or not quite a feminist.
He would take their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to go so much beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until it's not left.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or more good, an feminism more <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the one action and be a little bit more brave.
If I listen to music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a supply of the toxic supply.
These artists are not going to change their way to talk about women in their songs until <unk> the change actually affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify the worst choice.
But when bad decisions are justify that it makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve us and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
It's two girls and <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want to grow in a world.
So where they are encouraged by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to the sexual violence against women as sports, and <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio hunger when we hear songs that treat women as anything.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies not treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes treat their companions as <unk>
In any case, the men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post it in his magazine, to participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't have a number of enough women, so much to participate as a decision to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to engage in this kind of projects, we can also help to be including even more like us as we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the jobs.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and hope our decisions will come to the top, people in the power of directors and film film and music, <unk> the <unk> people who can make big decisions, more courageous, to create durable and significant change.
We can also affirm the courage to our feminism, good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> being a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, mostly because I had my voice -- my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to cope with what happened.
A few guys would tell me when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't tell me to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I get into a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have brown skin in this world.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it wasn't anything.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned how to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing, and I also found out that if it was a little brave -- another woman could <unk> and see me and realize that none of us is the nothing that the world is about telling us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to do anything.
And on the other, I fear the habits reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad <unk> I'm a good <unk> I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I do, and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same.
I hope that we can all be a little bit courageous, when you need a little bit of such courage.
Right after Christmas of last year, I spent children in California they had measles for having seen <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that measles can be terrible for a child with a <unk> immune system, is one of the most widely preventable disease in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the outbreak <unk> they hadn't been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly <unk>
But a moment, it was not the article that broke the argument on autism and the <unk> vaccines by being an fraud.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the population estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
Now, the few psychologists and <unk> who had heard about her creating their entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates continued to stable just three or four children for every <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic, as if it could catch another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like diagnostic diagnosis -- and a better detection <unk> to explain these numbers <unk>
But that kind of language doesn't dissipate a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks in the face of her son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to figure out why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were those cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to figure out the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less than seeing with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the power of <unk>
During the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is, and how it discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a children's psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked <unk> private worlds, <unk> people around it, even their own parents.
They could tickle him for hours by waving their hands before their faces, but they were rush to panic because when you don't put their favorite toys in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main state of the world in the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome as they are taking advantage of places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not wonder, because the criteria for the diagnosis of autism was very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he turned out that he had turned to nine from every 10 children in their office to their office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of psychotic child is caused by cold parents.
These kids, he said, they have stayed carefully at a fridge you didn't get to.
At the same time, though, <unk> noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they all had special skills that they all like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I reached two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he was properly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like children were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents were desperate to win their approval out.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it was not until the decade of the researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, I thought the theory of <unk> mothers was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John were warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed services, without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Service of Health of Health that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
<unk> a study of prevalence of autism in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find individual children in the community.
What you saw of clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse and diverse than autism was much more <unk>
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
In another way, these kids were not <unk> in beautiful <unk> and <unk> as <unk> and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have models.
At first, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one had no <unk> of these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in <unk> in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and that then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but he avoided <unk> on his own work.
There was not even an translation of the English language, but luckily, the husband of <unk> speak German, and he was translated it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinic that was integrated with a school that was an integrated school in Vienna in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for children with learning differences were <unk> even for <unk> standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music, and the kids were still their games for the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as a <unk> disability of life that required ways of support and spaces <unk> over the course of all life.
Instead of treating the kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called them their little teachers, and he went to help in the development of education that they were especially suitable for them.
<unk> had seen autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of skills and disabilities.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they have always been, and it's always been seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> of the pop culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is critical.
He <unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong in which autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria from the diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late 1980s and early '90s, their changes went into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> for a broad and <unk> model.
These changes don't fell in <unk>
<unk> when he <unk> and Judith worked between dinner to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I went out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance performance is like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four of the <unk> <unk> psychologists, and parents and parents all over the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they were introduced to the first serious clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I no longer have a connection with that little <unk> of experts to achieve a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started <unk> just like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact expected to be out there, allowing people to have autism and their families finally <unk> the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blaming vaccines for the increase in the diagnostics.
If the current estimate of the state of preventing that one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, <unk> are one of the world's largest <unk> groups.
Over the last few years, people have come together on the Internet to refuse the idea that the puzzles are for new advances in doctors, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think of terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean that it's cut.
According to <unk> <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it's suffering from attention deficit to detail.
<unk> people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we move towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence in the planet to address the challenges we face as society.
We cannot afford to waste a waste or a brain.
Thank you.
